sport,bridge could miss rest of season chelsea left-back wayne bridge could miss the rest of the season with a suspected broken ankle.  the england international  24  was hurt in an innocuous challenge with alan shearer during the londoners  fa cup defeat at newcastle on sunday.  we think it s a big injury   said jose mourinho  whose chelsea team this week meet barcelona in the champions league and liverpool in the carling cup final. william gallas and damien duff could also miss the barcelona game. france defender gallas and ireland winger duff both picked up their injuries in the closing stages of chelsea s 1-0 defeat at st james  park.  with bridge having gone off after mourinho used all three substitutes  those knocks plus carlo cudicini s red card meant chelsea finished the game with seven able-bodied players. cudicini would not have played against barcelona  but had been promised a game in the carling cup final  although he will now miss the cardiff showpiece through suspension. the manager is not planning to add any new names to his squad ahead of the trip to barcelona  even though he has few options to replace bridge at left-back.  celestine babayaro left the club in january  ironically to join newcastle  and although gallas has deputised at left-back before  he is struggling to be fit himself. it could be that paulo ferreira  usually a right-back  is switched to left-back with glen johnson  who ended the newcastle game in goal  playing on the right. youngsters ben hudell  joe keenan and sam tillen would be options should mourinho decide to call up a replacement  but it is unlikely he would risk an untried prospect in a champions league tie. bridge s injury also means mourinho  who reportedly wants to sign ashley cole from arsenal  will not have a specialist  senior left-back for the run-in to the season.   he (bridge) has no chance of playing against barcelona  probably will not play against liverpool (in the carling cup final) and maybe not for the rest of the season   he said.  the medical department will try to do everything to recover gallas and duff. we will have to wait and see  but i won t cry about injuries because we will have 11 players to play on tuesday.  shearer said he was unsure what caused bridge s injury.  i don t know what happened.  he said.  it was just a shame. i don t think we even touched each other.  by all accounts it s pretty serious. i went into the dressing-room after the game and wished him all the best.  mourinho  whose team are chasing three trophies  has already lost winger arjen robben to a serious injury.,3
business,borussia dortmund near bust german football club and former european champion borussia dortmund has warned it will go bankrupt if rescue talks with creditors fail.  the company s shares tumbled after it said it has  entered a life-threatening profitability and financial situation . borussia dortmund has posted record losses and missed rent payments on its westfallen stadium. chief executive gerd niebaum stepped down last week and creditors are now pushing for greater control. shares in borussia dortmund  germany s only stock-market listed football club  dropped by almost 23% to 2.05 euros during early afternoon trading.  fund manager florian hamm - borussia dortmund s largest investor - said he would only invest more money in the company if he got a greater say in how it is run.  i demand better transparency   he is quoted as saying by germany s manger magazin. the club has also faced calls to appoint executives from outside the club.  borussia dortmund posted a record loss of 68m euros ($89m; Â£47m) in the 12 months through june. it made a loss of 27.2m euros in the first half of the current fiscal year and said that total debts will increase to 134.7m euros by the middle of 2006 unless a restructuring plan is pushed through.  this is the bill for their mismanagement over the past years   said hvb analyst peter-thilo halser. the club appointed an auditor  who has recommended a number of steps  including deferring the rent due on the stadium and suspending debt repayments until at least the 2006-2007 fiscal year. stephen schechter  a uk investment banker who has held talks with borussia dortmund over a possible bond sale  said the club needs a capital injection of 35m euros.  they need strong people on the board who do not have a history with the club   he said.,0
politics,royal couple watch nation s mood prince charles and camilla parker bowles are awaiting the nation s reaction after announcing they are to be married on 8 april.  mrs parker bowles will take the title hrh duchess of cornwall after a civil ceremony to be held at windsor castle. a daily telegraph poll of 1 313 people suggests two-thirds of britons support the couple s decision to marry. but only 40% think mrs parker bowles should become princess consort as planned after charles becomes king. some 47% believe she should have no title  while 7% think she should become queen.  the poll also found that the majority of britons would prefer the monarchy to miss a generation  with the queen handing the throne to her grandson prince william  22  on her death or abdication. on thursday night  prince charles  56  and mrs parker bowles  57  hosted a dinner at windsor castle  their first public appearance since announcing their engagement. mrs parker bowles said the prince went down on one knee to propose and added:  i m just coming down to earth.  she displayed her diamond engagement ring - a royal family heirloom - to reporters. charles said he and his wife-to-be were  absolutely delighted . their marriage will end years of speculation on a relationship which dates back to 1970.  the queen and duke of edinburgh said the news had made them  very happy . princes william and harry said they are  very happy  and wish the couple  all the luck in the future . the wedding will be a civil ceremony followed by a service of prayer and dedication in st george s chapel at which the archbishop of canterbury  dr rowan williams  will preside.  the marriage is likely to be a sensitive issue because mrs parker bowles is divorced and her former husband is still alive. if he became king  charles would be the supreme governor of the church of england and some anglicans remain opposed to the remarriage of divorcees.  his divorce from diana and the disappointment the country felt over how diana had been treated... opened up a sense of disillusionment with [prince charles]   said ros coward  who wrote the authorised biography of diana  princess of wales. the archbishop of canterbury said:  i am pleased that prince charles and mrs camilla parker bowles have decided to take this important step.  tony blair said he was  delighted  for the couple and offered his congratulations  as did conservative leader michael howard and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy. australia s prime minister john howard also offered his congratulations  adding that their decision to marry was a  sensible and a good thing . mrs parker bowles has joined the prince at numerous engagements in recent years - mostly at evening events for the prince s trust. clarence house staff were at pains to point out that she attended these events in a private capacity.,2
sport,greek pair attend drugs hearing greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou have appeared before an independent tribunal which will decide if their bans should stand.  they were given provisional suspensions by athletics  ruling body the iaaf in december for failing to take drugs tests before the athens olympics. the pair arrived with former coach christos tzekos to give evidence at the hellenic olympic committee s offices. a decision is expected to be announced before the end of february. whatever the ruling  all parties will have the right to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport. yiannis papadoyiannakis  who was head of the greek olympic team at the athens games last year  also testified at the tribunal  along with other greek sports officials and athletes.  i believe the tribunal will reach a decision that will uphold the standing of the institution   said papadoyiannakis.  whatever the athletes have done  we must not forget that they have offered us great moments.  kenteris won 200m gold at the 2000 sydney olympics  while thanou won silver in the 100m.  they withdrew from the athens games last august after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony. the pair spent four days in a hospital  claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. the five-member tribunal  assembled by the hellenic association of amateur athletics  is also examining allegations that kenteris and thanou avoided tests in tel aviv and chicago before the games. tzekos was also banned for two years by the iaaf. he faces charges of assisting in the use of prohibited substances and tampering with the doping inspection process. all three  who have repeatedly denied the allegations  have also been charged by a greek prosecutor and face trial for doping-related charges. a trial date has not been set. in imposing two-year suspensions on the duo on 22 december  the iaaf described their explanations for missing the tests as  unacceptable . but kenteris  lawyer gregory ioannidis told bbc sport earlier this week he was confident the sprinters would be cleared of the charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to testing.  we refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical   he said.  there have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials  and these procedural breaches have also violated my client s rights.  there is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted.,3
tech,gritty return for prince of persia still basking in the relatively recent glory of last year s sands of time  the dashing prince of persia is back in warrior within  and in a more bellicose mood than last time.  this sequel gives the franchise a grim  gritty new look and ramps up the action and violence. as before  you control the super-athletic prince from a third-person perspective. the time-travelling plot hinges on the dahaka  an all-consuming monster pursuing our hero through the ages. the only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry empress of time before she ever creates the sands of time that caused the great beast s creation.  studiously structured though this back story is  everything boils down to old-fashioned fantasy gameplay which proves  on the whole  as dependable as it needs to be. ever since the series  then-groundbreaking beginnings on the commodore amiga  prince of persia has always been about meticulously-animated acrobatic moves  that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies  body parts.  those flashy moves are back in full evidence  and tremendous fun to perform and perfect. combining them at speed is the best fun  although getting a handle of doing so takes practice and plenty of skill. until you reach that point  it is a haphazard business. all too often  you will perform a stunning triple somersault  pirouette off a wall  knock out three enemies in one glorious swoop  before plummeting purposefully over a cliff to your doom. that in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance  for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path. the expected fiendish puzzles are all present and correct  but combat is what is really been stepped up  and there is more of it than before. the game s developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways. slicing foes down the middle is one particularly entertaining method of seeing them off.  warrior within is a very slick package; the game s intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences.  it is on a par with the jaw-dropping opening sequence of onimusha 3 earlier this year  and when the game begins  it is something of an anti-climax. that said  the graphics are excellent  and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game. the music is probably the worst aspect - a merit-free heavy metal soundtrack that you will swiftly want to turn off. there is something strangely unsatisfying about the game. perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be. somehow it adds up to less than the sum of its parts  and is more technically impressive than it is outright enjoyable. but that is not to say warrior within is anything other than a superb adventure that most will thoroughly enjoy. it just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for.,4
entertainment,hoffman hits out over modern film hollywood legend dustin hoffman has hit out at the quality of current films and theatre productions.  the star of rain man and tootsie said the film culture was  in the craphouse  at a press conference on tuesday. the 67-year-old also said he stopped working a few years ago because he lost his  spark  for acting. hoffman is in the uk to publicise his new comedy  meet the fockers  which also stars robert de niro  barbra streisand and ben stiller.  he said:  you go to the cinema and you realise you re watching the third act. there is no first or second act.  there is this massive film-making where you spend this incredible amount of money and play right to the demographic.  you can tell how much money the film is going to make by how it does on the first weekend.  the whole culture is in the craphouse. it s not just true in the movies  it s also true in the theatre.  broadway  and now london is the same  special effects are in great demand. it s not a good time culturally.   hoffman also said he stopped working a few years ago and moved into directing and writing. he said:  i just lost that spark i always had.  a couple of years ago i didn t like the parts i was getting.  studios weren t interested in the kind of films that people of my generation wanted to see.  i thought i would stop and just try writing and directing. i wasn t aware of the depression that set in.  recently  hoffmann has returned to film  with roles in i heart huckabees  finding neverland and now meet the fockers  which is the sequel to meet the parents. meet the fockers opens in the uk on friday.,1
business,french boss to leave eads the french co-head of european defence and aerospace group eads philippe camus is to leave his post.  mr camus said in a statement that he has accepted the invitation to return full-time to the lagardere group  which owns 30% of eads.  i will give up my role as soon as the board of directors asks me to do so   he said. airbus head noel forgeard is now set to replace mr camus  bringing the company s power struggle to an end. fighting between mr camus and mr forgeard has hit the headlines in france and analysts feared that this fighting could destabilise the defence and aerospace group. french finance minister herve gaymard is on record as saying that he  deplored  the infighting at the company. the company should now be able put this dispute behind it  with the departure of mr camus and with the clear support given to mr forgeard by the lagardere group  the main french shareholder of eads. the other main shareholders of eads are the french government (15%)   who also support mr forgeard  and germany s daimlerchrysler (30%). rainer hertrich  the german co-head of eads will also step down when his contract expires next year.  mr camus recently came under pressure as it became clear that the a380 superjumbo was running over budget. eads - airbus  majority owner - admitted earlier this week that the project was running 1.45bn euros (Â£1bn; $1.9bn) over budget. but mr forgeard has denied this  telling french media that there is no current overrun in the budget.  but for the sake of transparency  we told our shareholders last week that if we look at the forecast for total costs of the project up to 2010  there is a risk that we will go over by around 10%  which is about 1bn euros (Â£686m; $1.32bn)   he told france s lci television. due to enter service in 2006  the a380 will replace the boeing 747 jumbo as the world s biggest passenger aircraft.,0
entertainment,dvd review: i  robot only one man recognises that robots are a threat to humanity - but that s fine because it only takes one man to save the day in the thriller i  robot.  will smith co-stars alongside more cgi robots than you can count and as a thrill-a-minute kind of action film  it s perfectly adequate. you ll have forgotten it all tomorrow but you ll have a fun night with the film and all the extras. there is a one-disc version that has commentaries and a making of but the two-disc adds more. unusually for this kind of film  the extras don t solely concentrate on the special effects. they re covered but there s also a general production diary and a post-production feature.  remember the national lottery s draw machines arthur and guinevere  they were more accurate than this glossy hollywood version of the tale.  but as long as you re not expecting a documentary  live with it: king arthur is a fun  exciting  totally shallow experience and looks excellent. clive owen is the brooding king  keira knightly rises above her costume and ray winstone gives it all some grit. it s at its best in its battle scenes which are well done and are also the best part of the making of extra.  less flashy than a david attenborough show and less detailed than a simon schama one  the bbc series british isles nevertheless turned out to be quite engrossing. admit it  the fact that this is one of the shows alan titchmarsh left ground force to present did mean that you expected something equally frothy. but titchmarsh turns out to know his subject and the sight of our present-day landscape being peeled back to reveal the past was fascinating. he s now written an accompanying book  too.,1
business,healthsouth ex-boss goes on trial the former head of us medical services firm healthsouth overstated earnings and assets to boost the company s share price  it was claimed in court.  richard scrushy  52  is accused of  directing  a $2.7bn (Â£1.4bn) accounting fraud at the company he co-founded in alabama in 1984. prosecutors said he was motivated by wealth - spending about $200m between 1996 and 2002 while earning much less. defence lawyers said mr scrushy had been deceived by other executives. several former healthsouth employees have already pleaded guilty to fraud and are expected to give evidence against mr scrushy.   we will present evidence that richard scrushy knew about the conspiracy  that he participated in the conspiracy and that he profited   prosecutor alice martin told the court. mr scrushy is the first chief executive to be tried for breaching the sarbanes oxley act - a law introduced in the wake of the enron and worldcom frauds which obliges corporate bosses to vouch for the accuracy of their companies  results. among the charges he faces are conspiracy to commit fraud  filing false statements and money laundering. after federal agents raided healthsouth s offices in march 2003  the company said none of its past financial statements could be relied on. the firm has since reorganised its board and management team and currently operates about 1 400 health clinics.,0
politics,milburn defends poster campaign labour s election chief alan milburn has defended his party s campaign posters amid tory claims the ads were nothing short of  sly anti-semitism .  mr milburn said he appreciated people s concerns  but insisted that  what they were was anti-tory  and  not in any way  shape or form anti-semitic . he was responding to tory spokesman julian lewis who said the ads were part of a wider trend of smearing the party. labour has withdrawn two controversial posters and launched four new designs.  a row was sparked after the party published posters appearing to depict michael howard  who is jewish  as fagin  and as a flying pig  amid claims they were anti-semitic. the posters were labelled a  big misjudgement  by the conservatives who said labour s  first shot in the election has badly backfired .  the posters were among a series of ideas shown to labour members  who were asked to vote on their favourite. labour has taken them off its website  saying members preferred other posters. the party s four new designs  launched on tuesday  steer clear of the fagin or flying pig images  but make clear that labour is sticking to its strategy of targeting the tory leader personally  with reminders of his record in office.  the posters were among a series of ideas shown to labour members  who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election. in the commons  tory spokesman mr lewis suggested the posters were part of a wider trend and reminded mps that labour chairman ian mccartney last year described shadow chancellor oliver letwin as a  21st century fagin .   given the outrage that that smear caused then  how could you have thought anything other than the fact that what you were doing in reviving it in your poster advertisements was nothing more and nothing less than a calculated campaign of sly anti-semitism   mr milburn replied that they were not anti-semitic.  what they were was anti-tory and i make no apologies at all for making clear to the british public exactly what the conservative plans would mean   he said.  i fully understand and indeed respect the views of those who have concerns about any poster designs that have appeared on the labour party website.  the fagin and pigs might fly posters were taken off labour s website on monday after supporters voted for their favourite poster featuring mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin holding a blackboard reading 2+2=5. a labour spokesman later said their removal from the party s website was not affected by the row.,2

politics,protesters plan airport challenge campaigners against the expansion of britain s airports have begun challenging the government s plans in the high court.  baa s expansion of stansted airport in essex by building an extra runway is one of the most fiercely opposed plans. opponents say the Â£2bn cost of the new runway could not be met unless cash from heathrow and gatwick was used. they said this is illegal under current rules and are trying to block the government from changing legislation. baa are also owners of the airports at heathrow and gatwick. they have said they cannot raise the money needed for the stansted upgrades from current landing charges. baa also says it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans.  groups challenging the plans include stop stansted expansion  heathrow anti-noise campaigners hacan clearskies and the london boroughs of hillingdon and wandsworth. their opponents are also likely to complain there was no public consultation before an extra runway was built at luton airport  or when it changed take-off and landing procedures at heathrow. if the group wins  the government s future aviation plans outlined in last year s transport white paper could be left in ruins.  the campaigners will say the government did not adequately consider the building of new airports  such as one planned for the isle of sheppey east of london. lord hanningfield  leader of essex county council  told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  we are going to the high court because we want a judge to rule there should be a proper inquiry.  we want a judge to say there has been inadequate preparation  consultation and thought before the government came out with its green paper.  then there could be a proper debate nationally about where this extra capacity should go.  he added:  politicians should not decide where runways should be.  the stansted expansion  apart from the building of the new runway  would also need to include new terminal buildings to deal with the projected 50m passengers who will use it every year.  the airport is the hub of many of the no-frills airlines operating in the uk. but baa has said it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans. at heathrow  gatwick  edinburgh and glasgow airports  baa launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in september 2004  which will close next week. baa is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked  unblighted price. at heathrow  baa said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental  air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met. at gatwick  the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway.,2
politics,poll idols  face first hurdles vote for me - itv1 s pop idol style talent contest for would-be politicians - finally hits our screens this week.  over the next four days  hundreds of potential candidates will be whittled down by a panel of experts and public vote. the winner will then be encouraged to stand as an independent at the next general election  which is expected in the spring. but opinion is divided on whether any of the potential candidates unearthed so far have got what it takes to make it in politics.  any of them would make competent mps   former independent mp martin bell insisted on bbc radio 4 s today programme.  mr bell  who will be offering his advice to the contestants on wednesday  argues that westminster has its share of  odd balls  and the show will engage ordinary voters.  if it gets more people voting and more people interested in politics there is no harm in that   he said. but sir bernard ingham  margaret thatcher s former press secretary  took a less charitable view  accusing the programme of  corrupting politics .  he said the producers would not achieve their aim of re-engaging voters  with that bunch of nutters . to give sir bernard his dues  monday evening s opening episode did attract more than a smattering of eccentrics and self-publicists. among those chancing their arm were a druid priest and a former porn star  who insisted on removing her top to make her point about the legalisation of brothels. among the more eccentric policy proposals was a public holiday on bruce forsyth s birthday and bill oddie for prime minister. the show follows the time-honoured pop idol format  with queues of nervous hopefuls and a panel of three experts judging their performance.  the contestants were given 60 seconds to present their manifestos. then the final 25 were tested on their lobbying ability. they were then cross-examined by the panel  which was chaired by ex-itn political editor john sergeant  with television host lorraine kelly taking the nicki chapman role. but the real star of the show is kelvin mackenzie  in the simon cowell  mr nasty seat.  the former sun editor dispensed a stream of well-crafted insults and one-liners. his advice for one young contestant was to  get a haircut and a brain transplant . wheelchair user kevin donnellon was asked:  why on earth do you want our elected representatives to be disabled    don t you care about the inuit    implored guitar-toting environmental campaigner barry lim.  i don t care about them. i care about myself and when the sun s shining i think - fantastic   replied mr mackenzie.  mr lim later reduced the panel to fits of giggles as he outlined his plan to make people do community service instead of paying taxes.  when the prime minister turns to the chancellor and says how much have we got in the coffers mr brown  he says well  prime minister  bad news  all the houses in britain have been painted but actually nobody has paid any tax   observed mr mackenzie.  that was an total disaster. i just couldn t seem to think of things to say   a crestfallen mr lim confided in the show s presenter  jonathan maitland. irfan hanif  a 25-year-old doctor from bolton  made a good impression  even if he was a little thrown by mr mackenzie s suggestion that instead of being treated by the nhs  young drunks should  given a good beating  and left to die. dominic carman - son of late libel lawyer george carman - was voted through to the final 25  on a platform of cutting defence spending to boost education. opinion was more divided over rodney hylton-potts  a 59-year-old convicted fraudster. mr mackenzie thought the smooth-talking former solicitor - with a hardline on crime and immigration - deserved a chance to progress.  he could join the rest of the crooks in the houses of parliament.  but ms kelly said she  would not trust him as far as she could throw him . the series continues throughout the week  with the public given the chance to evict one prospective mp every night. itv will not fund the election campaign for the eventual winner  but the publicity could give the winner a flying start over other candidates.,2
sport,klinsmann issues lehmann warning germany coach jurgen klinsmann has warned goalkeeper jens lehmann he may have to quit arsenal to keep his world cup dreams alive.  lehmann is understudy to oliver kahn in the german squad  but has lost his place to manuel alumnia at highbury. klinsmann said:  it will be difficult for any of our players if he is not a first-choice at his club.  if jens is not arsenal s number one keeper  that is a problem for me. he must be playing regularly.  lehmann is desperate to keep his place in the germany squad when the country hosts the world cup in 2006. klinsmann added:  if he is not playing regularly he cannot be germany s number one keeper  or even number two keeper.  the situation for jens is that he is currently the number two keeper at arsenal. this could be critical if it remains the same during next season.,3
sport,barkley fit for match in ireland england centre olly barkley has been passed fit for sunday s six nations clash with ireland at lansdowne road.  barkley withdrew from bath s team for friday s clash with gloucester after suffering a calf injury in training. gloucester centre henry paul has also been cleared to play after overcoming an ankle injury. england coach andy robinson  who names his team on wednesday  has called up bath prop duncan bell following phil vickery s broken arm. with vickery sidelined for at least six weeks and julian white out with a neck injury  bell could make his england debut. bell  30  had set his sights on an international career with wales. but last december  the international rugby board confirmed that he could only be eligible for england as he had travelled on tour with them in 1998.  i thought i d burned all my bridges with england when i expressed an interest in wanting to play for wales  so it s fantastic to get this opportunity   he said. bell  who featured in the england a side which beat france 30-20 10 days ago  added:  i recognise that i got into the england a squad because of injuries.  and it s the same again in getting into the senior squad. but now that i have this opportunity i intend to take it fully if selected and play my heart out for my country.   england coach andy robinson could take a gamble and call inexperienced sale sharks prop andrew sheridan into his front row. but sheridan favours the loosehead side of the scrum and a more likely scenario is for uncapped bell - who was among the try-scorers when england a beat france a 30-20 nine days ago - to be drafted in.,3
sport,chelsea clinch cup in extra-time (after extra-time - score at 90 mins 1-1)  john arne riise volleyed liverpool ahead after 45 seconds but steven gerrard scored a 79th-minute own goal. blues boss jose mourinho was sent off for taunting liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game. drogba and kezman scored from close range before antonio nunez s header made for a tense finale. it was an amazing climax which gave mourinho his first silverware as chelsea manager. yet it was controversial too  after mourinho s sending off  apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the liverpool fans. there was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute.  riise could not have connected any better with morientes  cross as he smashed a left-foot volley past petr cech. the goal  the quickest-ever in a league cup final  stunned a blues side whose previously rock-solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to newcastle and barcelona in the previous week. the blues  attacking chances were limited  and jerzy dudek was equal to frank lampard s powerfully-struck drive and drogba s low shot. despite their frustration  chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break liverpool s well-organised defence.  joe cole had a shot blocked and a promising damien duff break was halted by a good tackle from djimi traore  but the reds reached half-time without any major scares. the blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged liverpool back. nevertheless  liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from dudek on 54 minutes  first at full stretch from gudjohnsen s header  then to smother william gallas  follow-up. and despite chelsea s possession  it was liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as luis garcia fed dietmar hamann whose shot forced a superb save from cech. and the blues  increasingly adventurous approach saw liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as paulo ferreira denied gerrard with a last-ditch tackle. but gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later - in the most unfortunate fashion - as he inadvertently deflected ferrerira s free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring chelsea level. that prompted mourinho s reaction which saw him sent off  but chelsea still pressed and duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining. dudek saved bravely at the irishman s feet  while milan baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time. drogba almost headed chelsea in front two minutes into extra-time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post. but seconds after the half-time interval  drogba made no mistake  picking the ball up from glen johnson s long throw inside the six-yard box and sidefooting home. and kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after gudjohnsen s cross in the 110th minute. there was still drama as nunez beat cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level  but despite liverpool s desperate attacks  chelsea clung on to win.  dudek  finnan  carragher  hyypia  traore (biscan 67)  luis garcia  gerrard  hamann  riise  kewell (nunez 56)  morientes (baros 74).  subs not used: pellegrino  carson.  hyypia  traore  hamann  carragher.  riise 1  nunez 113.  cech  paulo ferreira  ricardo carvalho  terry  gallas (kezman 74)  jarosik (gudjohnsen 45)  lampard  makelele  cole (johnson 81)  drogba  duff.  subs not used: pidgeley  tiago.  lampard  kezman  drogba  duff.  gerrard 79 og  drogba 107  kezman 112.  78 000  s bennett (kent).,3
sport,wales stars need a rest - ruddock wales coach mike ruddock has defended his decision not to release any of the international stars for this weekend s regional celtic league fixtures.  ruddock says the players will benefit from the rest  and their absence will give youngsters a chance to impress.  we ve got the wru charter in place now which outlines exactly what happens   ruddock told bbc wales sport.  once we re in the six nations  the players will only be released in his and the wru s best interests.  the ospreys and scarlets say they are happy to support the wales cause  but the dragons have expressed disappointment at not being able to use their national squad players in friday s game with ulster. ceri sweeney  gareth cooper  ian gough and kevin morgan have been used sparingly by ruddock in the opening two six nations wins and captain jason forster believes they would benefit from a game with the dragons.   i m sure the guys would want to come back to get some game time   forster told bbc wales sport.  it would also be a timely reminder to mike [ruddock] as to what they can do.  and the supporters want to see the star players - no disrespect to the other guys - performing on the pitch.  ruddock  though  is keen to protect his players from injury and fatigue.  at this stage  there s nothing more [the players] can do in games to impress me further.  we ve got to look at it at another angle and see the opportunities that are provided for the younger players in the region.  for example  the dragons might use james ireland this weekend. i ve been looking at the lad - he s a great prospect for the future.  french and english clubs have requested to have all their international players available which means stephen jones  gareth thomas and mefin davies will play this weekend. the majority of ireland and scotland players have also been released for provincial duty.,3
politics,tutu s guantanamo release call archbishop desmond tutu has called for the release of the remaining inmates at guantanamo bay and terror suspects detained without trial in the uk.  his comments follow news that all four britons held by the us in the cuban camp will be freed within weeks. the south african archbishop said detentions without trial were  unacceptable  and  distressing . twelve foreign nationals are being held indefinitely without trial in the uk under anti-terror laws. referring to the detentions in cuba  archbishop tutu told bbc news:  it is utterly unacceptable.  the rule of law is in order to ensure that those who have power don t use their power arbitrarily and every person retains their human rights until you have proven conclusively that so-and-so is in fact guilty.   moazzam begg  from birmingham  and martin mubanga  richard belmar and feroz abbasi  from london  have been held by the us at guantanamo bay for almost three years. on tuesday foreign secretary jack straw told the commons that the us had agreed to release the four after  intensive and complex discussions  over security. the britons were detained as part of the us-led  war on terror . the archbishop added:  whilst we are saying thank you that these have been released  what is happening to those left behind   we in south africa used to have a dispensation that detained people without trial and the world quite rightly condemned that as unacceptable.   now if it was unacceptable then how come it can be acceptable to britain and the united states. it is so  so deeply distressing.  following mr straw s announcement  lawyer louise christian  who represents mr abbasi and mr mubanga  said the government should have acted sooner. foreign nationals detained in the uk are being held at belmarsh and woodhill prisons. in december the house of lords  the uk s highest court  ruled that the anti-terror measures broke human rights laws. but the men are still behind bars.  archbishop tutu criticised the measures  saying:  i am opposed to any arbitrary detention that is happening  even in britain.  shami chakrabarti  director of civil rights group liberty  has called on the government to  practise what it preaches  and either free or charge the detained men. but the home office defended the measures. a spokesman said:  these individuals cannot currently be prosecuted because some evidence  such as that provided by third parties  cannot safely be disclosed in criminal proceedings without putting others at risk.  it is also currently the case that intelligence gained from covert intercepts cannot be used in a court of law.,2
politics,what really divides the parties so what is the gap between labour and the tories nowadays   one starbucks  one rymans and one small greek cafe as it happens. both parties have now completed their moves to new headquarters  with labour creating its election hub just three doors away from the tories  new headquarters in victoria street  just down the road from the commons. that should make things a little easier if and when the crack-of-dawn election press conferences kick off. unlike 2001  there should be no need for colleagues to have taxis gunning their engines outside  or to buy scooters  to get themselves between the tightly-timetabled events.  and  to all intents and purposes  we already appear to be in that general election campaign. certainly the press conference hosted by election co-ordinator alan milburn  in the rather compact new conference room - still smelling of new carpet and with the garish new labour coffee mugs as yet unstained - had all the hallmarks of an election event.   welcome to the unremittingly new labour media centre   he said. and i ll bet he hadn t checked that one with gordon brown. along with work and pensions secretary alan johnson and minister for work jane kennedy  he then went on to tear into the tory plans to scrap the new deal welfare-to-work scheme  which they claimed would lead to an increase of almost 300 000 in unemployment. and they ridiculed the claims made on monday by michael howard that he could save Â£35 billion of labour waste and inefficiency to spend on public services while also offering Â£4 billion of tax cuts. labour has come up with a figure of Â£22 billions worth of efficiency savings so  understandably perhaps  believe mr howard must be planning cuts to squeeze the extra Â£13 billion. these figures  based on the two parties  own detailed studies  will be battered to within an inch of their lives during the campaign. wednesday was just the start.,2
business,khodorkovsky ally denies charges a close associate of former yukos boss mikhail khodorkovsky has told a court that fraud charges levelled against him are  false .  platon lebedev has been on trial alongside mr khodorkovsky since june in a case centring around the privatisation of a fertiliser firm. the pair claim they are being punished by the authorities for the political ambitions of mr khodorkovsky. mr lebedev said there were  absurd contradictions  in the case. opening his defence  he said he could not see the legal basis of the charges he faced  which also include allegations of tax evasion.  to my embarrassment  i could not understand the file of complaints against me   he told a moscow court. mr lebedev headed the menatep group  the parent company of yukos.  mr lebedev and mr khodorkovsky  who each face a possible 10 year jail sentence if convicted  will be questioned by a judge over the next few days. mr khodorkovsky began his testimony last week  telling the court that he objected to the way that the  running of a normal business has been presented as a work of criminal fiction . the charges are seen by supporters as politically motivated and part of a drive by russian president vladimir putin to rein in the country s super-rich business leaders  the so-called oligarchs. yukos has been presented with a $27.5bn (Â£13bn) tax demand by the russian authorities and its key yugansk division was auctioned off to part settle the bill. the company s effort to gain bankruptcy protection in the us - in a bid to win damages for the sale - were dismissed by a court in texas.,0
entertainment,pete doherty misses bail deadline singer pete doherty will have to spend the weekend in jail because he could not come up with Â£150 000 bond money for his bail on time.  the former libertines singer had been granted bail with curfew restrictions at highbury corner magistrates court on charges of robbery and blackmail. but his lawyer said the money could not be raised on time. mr doherty  25  was arrested following an alleged incident in a london hotel on wednesday evening. musician alan wass  23  also of north london  appeared in court accused of the same offences.  magistrates imposed a range of bail conditions on mr doherty including a curfew between 2200 and 0700  except when he attends a drug rehabilitation centre. he was told he would not be able to leave his home without being accompanied by a security firm. he must also surrender his passport and report daily to a local police station. mr wass was also given a curfew and told to surrender his passport. mr doherty left the libertines at the end of june 2004  but continued performing with his band babyshambles. the singer  who has been linked to supermodel kate moss  was arrested after police were called to the islington hotel in response to claims that a man had been assaulted. a man in his 30s was later taken to university college hospital  london  with facial injuries  before being discharged. a lawyer representing mr doherty and mr wass said outside court the pair strenuously denied the charges.,1
business,china keeps tight rein on credit china s efforts to stop the economy from overheating by clamping down on credit will continue into 2005  state media report.  the curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices. there were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. growth in china remains at a breakneck 9.1%  and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year. the breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year. rapid tooling-up of china s manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year. in theory  the government has a 7% growth target  but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a  hard landing  in the shape of an overbalancing economy. a low exchange rate - china s yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar  which seems to be in relentless decline - means chinese exports are cheap on world markets. china has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg. to some extent  the credit controls do seem to be taking effect. industrial output grew 15.7% in the year to october  down from 23% in february  and inflation slowed to 4.3% - although retail sales are still booming.,0
entertainment,us tv special for tsunami relief a us television network will screen a celebrity tv special to benefit the tsunami relief effort in south asia.  nbc will encourage viewer donations during an hour-long show featuring musical performances on 15 january. actress sandra bullock has donated $1m (Â£525 000) to the american red cross and actor leonardo dicaprio pledged a  sizable  aid contribution to unicef. meanwhile 70 hong kong music and movie stars re-recorded we are the world in mandarin and cantonese to raise funds.  the song will not be released as a single  but will be played regularly during a chinese telethon on friday in aid of victims of the boxing day disaster. around 140 000 people were killed and five million left homeless or without food and water after an earthquake below the indian ocean sent waves crashing into coastal communities in 11 countries.  the united nations warned that the number killed in the disaster could rise sharply  with aid yet to reach some remote areas. performers have yet to be confirmed for nbc s aid relief benefit later this month. it follows a two-hour telethon carried by all four major us television networks 10 days after the 11 september terror attacks in 2001. america: a tribute to heroes raised more than $150m (Â£79m) to help victims of the suicide attacks on the world trade center and pentagon.,1
tech,slimmer playstation triple sales sony playstation 2 s slimmer shape has proved popular with uk gamers  with 50 000 sold in its first week on sale.  sales have tripled since launch  outstripping microsoft s xbox  said market analysts chart-track. the numbers were also boosted by the release of the ps2-only game grand theft auto: san andreas. the title broke the uk sales record for video games in its first weekend of release. latest figures suggest it has sold more than 677 000 copies.   it is obviously very  very encouraging for sony because microsoft briefly outsold them last week   john houlihan  editor of computerandvideogames.com told bbc news.  and with halo 2 [for xbox] out next week  it really is a head-to-head contest between them and xbox.   although xbox sales over the last week also climbed  ps2 sales were more than double that. the figures mean sony is reaching the seven million barrier for uk sales of the console. edinburgh-based developer  rockstar  which is behind the gta titles  has seen san andreas pull in an estimated Â£24m in gross revenues over the weekend. in comparison  blockbuster films like harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban took Â£11.5m in its first three days at the uk box office. the lord of the rings: the return of the king took nearly Â£10m over its opening weekend  although games titles are four to five times more expensive than cinema tickets.  gangster-themed gta san andreas is the sequel to grand theft auto vice city which previously held the record for the fastest-selling video game ever. the xbox game halo 2  released on 11 november in the uk  is also widely tipped to be one of the best-selling games of the year. the original title won universal acclaim in 2001  and sold more than four million copies.  mr houlihan added that sony had done well with the ps2  but it definitely helped that the release of san andreas coincided with the slimline ps2 hitting the shelves. the run-up to christmas is a huge battlefield for games consoles and titles. microsoft s xbox had been winning the race up until last week in sales. the sales figures also suggest that it may be a largely adult audience driving demand  since gta san andreas has an 18 certificate. sony and microsoft have both reduced console prices recently and are preparing the way for the launches of their next generation consoles in 2005.  both have hit crucial price points at around Â£100 and that really does open up new consoles to new audience  plus the release of two really important games in terms of development are also driving those sales   said mr houlihan.,4
business,german jobless rate at new record more than 5.2 million germans were out of work in february  new figures show.  the figure of 5.216 million people  or 12.6% of the working-age population  is the highest jobless rate in europe s biggest economy since the 1930s. the news comes as the head of germany s panel of government economic advisers predicted growth would again stagnate. speaking on german tv  bert ruerup said the panel s earlier forecast of 1.4% was too optimistic and warned growth would be just 1% in 2005.  the german government is trying to tackle the stubbornly-high levels of joblessness with a range of labour market reforms. at their centre is the  hartz-iv  programme introduced in january to shake up welfare benefits and push people back into work - even if some of the jobs are heavily subsidised. the latest unemployment figures look set to increase the pressure on the government. widely leaked to the german newspapers a day in advance  they produced screaming headlines criticising chancellor gerhard schroeder s social democrat-green party administration. mr schroeder had originally come into office promising to halve unemployment.  still  some measures suggest the picture is not quite so bleak. the soaring official unemployment figure follows a change in the methodology which pushed up the jobless rate by more than 500 000 in january. adjusted for seasonal changes  the overall unemployment rate is 4.875 million people or 11.7%  up 0.3 percentage points from the previous month. using the most internationally-accepted methodology of the international labour organisation (ilo)  germany had 3.97 million people out of work in january. and ilo-based figures also suggest that 14 000 new net jobs were created that month  taking the number of people employed to 38.9 million. the ilo defines an unemployed person as someone who in the previous four weeks had actively looked for work they could take up immediately.,0
tech,smartphones suffer skulls attack owners of some nokia smartphones are being warned to watch out for malicious wallpaper.  those downloading the software could find all the icons on their 7610 phone swapped for images of skulls. when installed the malicious program also locks many of the 7610 s functions making it hard to use and harder to repair. the program is only the latest in a series of viruses produced to attack mobile phones.  the file  nicknamed skulls  is thought to have surfaced on shareware sites where people can pick up free add-ons  such as wallpaper  games and ringtones  for their phones symbian said that it was not sure if the damage skulls does was intentional or simply a result of bad programming. soon after being discovered the file is thought to have been removed from the sites that were unwittingly harbouring it. the program is masquerading as software that creates new background images and themes for the main screen of the 7610 phone. the skulls program is labelled as a file called: 7610.extended.theme.manager.zip.  once installed the program replaces all the icons on the main page with skulls and replaces all the working applications  such as contacts  calendar  notebook etc with non-working versions so the phone becomes almost useless. the only thing the phone can do is make and take calls. a statement by symbian played down the significance of the malicious program and said few people would fall victim to it as users have to go through several steps to install it  one of which includes ignoring a security warning. symbian said that the spread of the skulls program was likely to be limited as the program cannot travel from one phone to another by itself. despite this finnish anti-virus lab f-secure said it had sporadic reports of 7610 owners being caught out by it. the firm has produced guidance for users caught out to help them remove the program and get their phone working again. the skulls program is thought to have been written by a malicious hacker using the alias tee-222. symbian phones produced by sony ericsson  motorola  benq  arima and fujitsu are unaffected by the skulls program.,4
tech,spam e-mails tempt net shoppers computer users across the world continue to ignore security warnings about spam e-mails and are being lured into buying goods  a report suggests.  more than a quarter have bought software through spam e-mails and 24% have bought clothes or jewellery. as well as profiting from selling goods or services and driving advertising traffic  organised crime rings can use spam to glean personal information. the business software alliance (bsa) warned that people should  stay alert .  many online consumers don t consider the true motives of spammers   said mike newton  a spokesperson for the bsa which commissioned the survey.   by selling software that appears to be legitimate in genuine looking packaging or through sophisticated websites  spammers are hiding spyware without consumers  knowledge.  once the software is installed on pcs and networks  information that is given over the internet can be obtained and abused.   the results also showed that the proportion of people reading - or admitting to reading - and taking advantage of adult entertainment spam e-mails is low  at one in 10. the research  which covered 6 000 people in six countries and their attitudes towards junk e-mails  revealed that brazilians were the most likely to read spam. a third of them read unsolicited junk e-mail and 66% buy goods or services after receiving spam.  the french were the second most likely to buy something (48%)  with 44% of britons taking advantage of products and services. this was despite 38% of people in all countries being worried about their net security because of the amount of spam they get. more than a third of respondents said they were concerned that spam e-mails contained viruses or programs that attempted to collect personal information.  both industry and the media have helped to raise awareness of the issues that surround illegitimate e-mail  helping to reduce the potential financial damage and nuisance from phishing attacks and spoof websites   said william plante  director of corporate security and fraud protection at security firm symantec.  at the same time  consumers need to continue exercising caution and protect themselves from harm with a mixture of spam filters  spyware detection software and sound judgement.,4
sport,strachan turns down pompey former southampton manager gordon strachan has rejected the chance to become portsmouth s new boss.  the scot was pompey chairman milan mandaric s first choice to replace harry redknapp  who left fratton park for rivals saints earlier in december.  i think it s a fantastic job for anybody apart from somebody who has just been the southampton manager   strachan told the bbc. club director terry brady held initial talks with strachan on saturday. the former scotland international added that joining southampton s local rivals would not be a wise move.  it s got everything going for it but i ve got too many memories of the other side and i don t want to sour those memories   he said.  everything s right - it s 10 minutes away  there are good players there  a good set-up  a good atmosphere at the ground.  there s lots to do but it s not right for somebody who has just been the southampton manager.  since redknapp s departure  executive director velimir zajec and coach joe jordan have overseen first-team affairs.  the duo had gone five matches unbeaten until sunday s 1-0 defeat at home to champions arsenal  but the club are still in a respectable 12th place in the premiership table. strachan left st mary s in february  after earlier announcing his intention to take a break from the game at the end of the 2003-04 season. his previous managerial experience came at coventry  whom he led for five years from 1996 to 2001.,3
politics,final hunts held as ban looms hunts in england and wales have begun on the last day that hunting with dogs is legal  with more due out later.  thousands of supporters are expected to turn out at more than 250 meets  many of which have altered their normal schedules to be out on a thursday. the ban on hunting with dogs comes into effect from 0001 gmt on friday. the countryside alliance had its latest legal bid to block the ban thwarted on wednesday when the appeal court ruled the hunting act was lawful.  but the group says hunting will continue in some form after the ban comes in  with hunts expected to test the new law to its limits. others are expected to defy the ban by continuing to hunt illegally.  anti-hunt organisations  for whom the ban is the culmination of years of campaigning  say they hope most will stay within the law. mike hobday  of the league against cruel sports  told bbc news:  we ve long urged them to go drag hunting - to follow an artificial scent - and that is what we hope they do.  but if they continue to chase foxes  to chase wild mammals around the countryside  that s against the law and we re confident they ll be brought to justice.  at the headquarters of quorn hunt in leicestershire  feelings were running high as hunt enthusiasts prepared for their final legal hunt. bbc correspondent sarah mukherjee said hunt supporters were in tears.  she said many people did not share the countryside alliance s optimism that hunting would be able to continue. farmer geoff brooks  a senior member of the quorn hunt  told bbc news people s lives  revolved around hunting . he described the ban as  ridiculous  and  badly thought out  but said it would be hard for most people to defy it as they would not want to risk their incomes by getting a criminal record.  at the court of appeal on wednesday  the countryside alliance failed in its attempt to have the hunting act ruled invalid. but it says the ban is unenforceable because the law is unclear and impossible to police.  the alliance says hunt supporters will go out and test this law to its limits on saturday. the league against cruel sports and the rspca say they will monitor hunts and assist police in bringing prosecutions. the association of chief police officers has issued guidance to forces on how to deal with the new rules. a spokesman said:  basically  it s not going to be police officers chasing about in cars across fields  it will be based on intelligence and information received as well.  the decision on how to police individual hunts will be left to local forces  with more officers sent to hunts where disruption is expected. he said police would consider evidence submitted by anti-hunt organisations on its merits.,2
politics,terror detainees win lords appeal detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws  the uk s highest court has ruled.  in a blow to the government s anti-terror measures  the house of lords law lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by nine detainees. most of the men are being indefinitely held in belmarsh prison  south london. the law lords said the measures were incompatible with european human rights laws. the men will stay behind bars while ministers decide how to react. the ruling creates a major problem for charles clarke on his first day as home secretary following david blunkett s resignation. the liberal democrats say mr clarke should use the fact he is new to the job to take issue with a law established by his predecessor  david blunkett. belmarsh prison has been dubbed britain s guantanamo bay by civil rights campaigners opposed to the use of emergency anti-terror laws.  the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office s powers to hold them without limit or charge. the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 september attacks in the us. any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. however those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland.  on thursday  senior law lord lord bingham said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions  in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status . lord nicholls of birkenhead  in his ruling  said:  indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law.  it deprives the detained person of the protection a criminal trial is intended to afford.   he said the weakness for the government s case was that it was trying to justify detention without trial for foreign suspects - but not for british suspects. lord hoffmann said:  the real threat to the life of the nation  in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values  comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these.  but lord walker of gestingthorpe  the one law lord to oppose the appeal  said the anti-terror laws contained important safeguards against oppression.  in a statement  detainee  a  in woodhill prison said:  i hope now that the government will act upon this decision  scrap this illegal  law  and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones.  the case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case. ben emmerson qc  representing seven of the detainees  said the men had already been in custody for nearly three years. he said they had been given no idea when  if ever  they would be released  had never been formally interviewed and there was no prospect they would ever be put on trial. when the men were first held  they took their cases to the special immigration appeals commission (siac). the commission ruled on 30 july  2002 that the anti-terror act unjustifiably discriminated against foreign nationals as british people could not be held in the same way. but that ruling was later overturned by the court of appeal who said there was a state of emergency threatening the life of the nation.,2
politics,visa decision  every 11 minutes  visa processing staff are sometimes expected to rule on an application every 11 minutes  mps have said.  pressure was placed on staff to be efficient  rather than to do a thorough examination of an application  the public accounts committee found. every officer had an annual target of 8 000 applications - equivalent to 40 a day or one every 11 minutes. mps want research into whether uk visa holders leave at the end of their stays  or vanish into the black market. committee chairman edward leigh said:  there is a worrying tension between quick processing and proper control over the visas issued.  entry clearance staff are expected to deal with a visa application in about 11 minutes which is surely too little time to look closely at the supporting documents.    the committee s report also discussed the romanian and bulgarian visas scandal which led to the resignation of immigration minister beverley hughes last year. committee members said the home office had been wrong to dismiss concerns from visa staff abroad who feared the system was being abused. investigations carried out in the wake of ms hughes  resignation found more than 7 000 people had entered the uk under the business visa scheme for romanian and bulgarian  entrepreneurs . mr leigh said the home office should now consider removing those who had not set up a valid business. a home office spokesman said the system had been toughened and tightened since the investigation. he added  that the traditional system of a dual decision making process for all pre-entry applications will be replaced by a single pre-entry check at post  which will be simpler and more robust against abuse than the current system .,2
tech,blogger grounded by her airline a us airline attendant is fighting for her job after she was suspended over postings on her blog  or online diary.  queen of the sky  otherwise known as ellen simonetti  evolved into an anonymous semi-fictional account of life in the sky. but after she posted pictures of herself in uniform  delta airlines suspended her indefinitely without pay. ms simonetti was told her suspension was a result of  inappropriate  images. delta airlines declined to comment.   i was really shocked  i had no warning   ms simonetti told bbc news online.  i never thought i would get in trouble because of the blog. i thought if they had a problem  someone would have said something before taking action.  the issue has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest  employment law and free speech on personal websites. ms simonetti was suspended on 25 september pending an investigation and has since lodged a complaint with the us equal employment opportunity commission (eeoc). a spokesperson for delta airlines told bbc news online:  all i can tell you is we do not discuss internal employee issues with the media.  she added she could not say whether a similar situation over personal websites had occurred in the past.  ms simonetti started her personal blog in january to help her get over her mother s death. she had ensured she made no mention of which airline she worked for  and created fictional names for cities and companies. the airline s name was changed to anonymous airline and the city in which she was based was called quirksville. a large part of the blog contained fictional stories because queen of the sky developed over the months as a character in her own right  according to ms simonetti.  the images were taken from a digital camera she had inherited from her mother.  we often take pictures on flight or on layovers. i just though why not include them on my blog for fun.  i never meant it as something to harm my company and don t understand how they think it did harm them   ms simonetti said. she has also claimed that pictures of male delta airline employees in uniform are freely available on the web. of the 10 or so images on the site  only one showed ms simonetti s flight  wings .  they did not tell me which pictures they had a problem with. i am just assuming it was the one of me posing on seats where my skirt rode up   she said. the images were removed as soon as she learned she had been suspended. as far as ms simonetti knows  there is no company anti-blogging policy. there is guidance which suggests the company uniform cannot be used without approval from management  but use in personal pictures on websites is unclear.  jeffrey matsuura  director of the law and technology programme at the university of dayton  said personal websites can be hazardous for both employers and their employees.  there are many examples of employees who have presented some kind of material online that have gotten them in trouble with employers   he said. it was crucial that any policy about what was and what was not acceptable was expressed clearly  was reasonable  and enforced fairly in company policy.  you have to remember that as an employee  you don t have total free speech anymore   he said. mr matsuura added that some companies actively encouraged employees to blog.  one of the areas where it does become a problem is that they encourage this when it suits them  but they may not be particularly clear when they [employees] do cross the line.  he speculated that delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images of ms simonetti in uniform were posted.  whether or not that is successful will depend on what exactly is prohibited  and whether you can reasonably say this content now crosses that line   he said. ms simonetti said her suspension has caused two of her friends to discontinue their blogs. one of them was asked to stop blogging by his company before any action was taken.  if they had asked me just take down the blog  i would have done it  but that was not been given to me as an option   she said.  this blogging thing is obviously a new problem for employers and they need to get a policy about it. if i had known it would cost me my job  i would not have done that.,4
business,irish duo could block man utd bid irishmen jp mcmanus and john magnier  who own a 29% stake in manchester united  will reportedly reject any formal Â£800m offer for the club.  the sunday times and the sunday telegraph say they will oppose any formal Â£800m takeover bid from us tycoon malcom glazer. mr glazer got permission to look at the club s accounts last week. irish billionaires mr mcmanus and mr magnier are said to believe that an Â£800m bid undervalues club prospects.  mr magnier and mr mcmanus  who hold their stake through their cubic expression investment vehicle have the power to block a bid. mr glazer s financial backers  including jp morgan  the us investment bank have said they won t back a bid unless it receives backing from the owners of at least 75% of the club s shares. however  there has been much speculation that the irish duo simply do not think the price offered - 300p a share - is high enough. mr glazer has been stalking the premier league football club since 2003.  mr magnier and mr mcmanus issued a statement late on friday saying that they remained  long-term investors  in man utd. the sunday telegraph says the board of manchester united also considered a management buyout at just over 300p but did not go ahead with it.,0
tech,us peer-to-peer pirates convicted the first convictions for piracy over peer-to-peer networks have been handed down in the us.  new yorker william trowbridge and texan michael chicoine have pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music  movies and software. the two men faced charges following raids in august on suspected pirates by the fbi. the pair face jail terms of up to five years and a $250 000 (Â£130 000) fine.  in a statement the us department of justice said the two men operated the central hubs in a piracy community organised across the direct connect peer-to-peer network. the piracy group called itself the underground network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files. direct connect allows users to set themselves up as central servers that act as co-ordinating spots for sharers. users would swap files  such as films and music  by exchanging data over the network. during its investigation fbi agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies  40 software programs  13 games and 178  sound recordings  from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group. the raids were organised under the umbrella of operation digital gridlock which was aimed at fighting  criminal copyright theft on peer-to-peer networks . in total  six raids were carried out in august. five were on the homes of suspected copyright thieves and one on a net service firm. the department of justice said that both men pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit felony copyright infringement. they also pleaded guilty to acting for commercial advantage. the two men are due to be sentenced on 29 april.,4
sport,melzer shocks agassi in san jose second seed andre agassi suffered a comprehensive defeat by jurgen melzer in the quarter-finals of the sap open.  agassi was often bamboozled by the austrian s drop shots in san jose  losing 6-3 6-1. defending champion and top seed andy roddick rallied to beat sweden s thomas enqvist 3-6 7-6 (8-6) 7-5. but unseeded cyril saulnier beat the fourth seed vincent spadea 6-2 6-4 and tommy haas overcame eighth seed max mirnyi 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-3) 6-2. melzer has now beaten agassi in two of their three meetings.   i had a good game plan and i executed it perfectly   he said.  it s always tough to come out to play andre.  i didn t want him to play his game. he makes you run like a dog all over the court.  and agassi  who was more than matched for power by his opponent s two-handed backhand  said melzer was an example of several players on the tour willing to take their chances against him.  a lot more guys are capable of it now   said the american.  he played much better than me. that s what he did both times.  i had opportunities to loosen myself up   agassi added.  but i didn t convert on the big points.,3
business,yukos sues four firms for $20bn russian oil firm yukos has sued four companies for their role in last year s forced state auction of its key oil production unit yuganskneftegas.  yukos is claiming more than $20bn (Â£11bn) in damages after yugansk was sold in december to settle back taxes. the four companies named in the law suit are gas giant gazprom  its unit gazpromneft  investment company baikal  and state oil firm rosneft. yukos submitted the suit in houston  where it filed for bankruptcy. as well as suing for damages  yukos has asked the us court to send its tax dispute with the russian government to an international arbitrator. it also has submitted a reorganisation plan as part of its chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.  the clash between yukos and the kremlin came to a head last year when yukos was hit with a bill of more than $27bn in back taxes and unpaid fines. to settle the bill  russia forced yukos to sell off yuganskneftegas.  yukos called the sale illegal and has turned to courts in the us in an effort to regain control of the oil production business. it also has vowed to use all legal means at its disposal to go after any firm that tries to buy or take control of its assets. earlier this month it sued the russian government for $28.3bn. analysts have questioned whether a us court has any jurisdiction over russian companies  while moscow officials have dismissed yukos  legal wrangling as meaningless. in houston  bankruptcy judge letitia clark will start a two-day hearing on 16 february to hear arguments on whether a us court is the proper forum for the case.  the threat of legal action from yukos and its bankruptcy filing in houston did have an effect on last year s auction  however. concerned that it would be caught up in a court battle  gazprom and gazpromneft withdrew from the auction  and yuganskneftegas was sold to little-known investment firm baikal finance group. a few days later  baikal gave control of the company to state-run oil group rosneft for $9.3bn. rosneft  meanwhile  has agreed to merge with gazprom  bringing a large chunk of russia s very profitable oil business back under state control. yukos claims that the rights of its shareholders have been ignored and that is has been punished for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky  once russia s richest man  is in prison  having been charged with fraud and tax evasion and repeatedly denied bail.,0
sport,iaaf to rule on greek sprint pair greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou are expected to find out on wednesday if they will be banned for missing drugs tests this summer.  the international association of athletics federations (iaaf) council held a conference call on tuesday and are set to announce their decision. kenteris and thanou could be suspended for up to two years. the duo withdrew from the olympics after missing a test but claimed they had suffered a motorcycle crash. the greek authorities have also brought criminal charges against the sprinters for avoiding a drugs test and faking an accident. their former coach christos tzekos is also facing charges and all three are awaiting a trial date.  however  the iaaf will determine the sprinters  future on the track after carefully considering all the evidence. the sport s ruling body is expected to direct the greek federation in what action it should take against the sprinters. kenteris and thanou can appeal against any decision at the court of arbitration for sport. the sprinters both sent written explanations to the iaaf  which have been taken into account. the iaaf sent an official warning to the sprinters and coach tzekos after they were discovered training in qatar rather than in crete  where they had said they would be. but kenteris and thanou then went on to skip tests in tel aviv and chicago  when they decided to fly back to greece early. just before the olympics  the pair dramatically missed another test in athens before withdrawing from the games. kenteris  31  won gold in the 200m at the sydney olympics in 2000  where thanou  29  won silver in the 100m.,3

entertainment,shark tale dvd is us best-seller oscar-nominated animation shark tale has raked in $80m (Â£42.4m) in the first week of its us dvd release becoming the year s best-selling home video so far.  the tally for its dvd and video sales soared past the film s opening week us box office takings of $56m (Â£29.7m). shark tale is now the sixth-highest earning dvd for first week sales. the all-time first-week record is held by 1995 s lion king followed by shrek 2  finding nemo  the original shrek  and monster s inc.  shark tale  whose voice cast includes will smith  robert de niro  renee zellweger and martin scorsese  sold more than 6 million dvds and videos across the united states and canada. it becomes the highest first-week earner for february  outshining my big fat greek wedding which sold four million units in 2003. films which are expected to earn strong home video returns are usually timed for release in the busiest retail season which falls before christmas. the best-selling home video of last year was the dreamworks hit shrek 2  which took an estimated $458 m (Â£242.7m) in north america alone.,1
sport,time to get tough on friendlies  for an international manager  a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players.  the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce. some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week  and do away with the 90 minutes at the end.  i would say it s 50-50 whether you should have these games or not  and if you look at it that way you would probably say you re better not doing so. it would certainly keep club managers happy  as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured. but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing. the more you play together  the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarter-finals against brazil. often in friendlies  though  a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half. and it s very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes  let alone a whole team s worth. the debate will rage on  and i m not sure there is a satisfactory solution. one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith. the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts. it is the sort of move you would expect from walter  who is a canny manager.  the players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers. if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten  it would have done them no good whatsoever. john toshack has his first game in charge of wales  and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary. he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance  but the public wants results. it s extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies. if you win  people forget them  but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you. england s game against holland is a good example. it looks like a good opportunity to try out players like middlesbrough winger stewart downing or crystal palace striker andy johnson. but you have got to remember sven-goran eriksson s side were given a lesson by spain in the last game they played.  the injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of wes brown and jamie carragher a chance to impress. for the club managers  it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed.,3
entertainment,u2 to play at grammy awards show irish rock band u2 are to play live at the grammy awards presentation in the us next month  organisers have said.  other acts to play include soul singer alicia keys  country singer tim mcgraw and punk band green day at the event on 13 february in los angeles. u2 are nominated twice for their recent single vertigo  including a nomination for best rock song. this year the grammys have been dominated by rap star kanye west  who is in contention for 10 awards. us comedian ellen degeneres and singer christine milian will present awards at the event. last week grammy producers announced the show will be hosted by rap star and chicago actress queen latifah. it will be held at the staples center. u2 had number one success in the album charts on both sides of the atlantic in november when their latest studio album  how to dismantle an atomic bomb  topped the us and uk charts. the band  who are also dominated for best international album at this year s brit awards  are to undertake a major world tour this year  their first for four years.,1
business,card fraudsters  targeting web  new safeguards on credit and debit card payments in shops has led fraudsters to focus on internet and phone payments  an anti-fraud agency has said.  anti-fraud consultancy retail decisions says  card-not-present  fraud  where goods are paid for online or by phone  has risen since the start of 2005. the introduction of  chip and pin  cards has tightened security for transactions on the high street. but the clampdown has caused fraudsters to change tack  retail decisions said.  the introduction of chip and pin cards aimed to cut down on credit card fraud in stores by asking shoppers to verify their identity with a confidential personal pin number  instead of a signature. retail decisions chief executive carl clump told the bbc that there was  no doubt  that chip and pin would  reduce card fraud in the card-present environment .  however  it is important to monitor what happens in the card-not-present environment as fraudsters will turn their attention to the internet  mail order  telephone order and interactive tv   he said.  we have seen a 22% uplift in card-not-present fraud here in the uk... since the start of the year.  fraud doesn t just disappear  it mutates to the next weakest link in the chain   he said.  retail decisions  survey on the implementation of chip and pin found that shoppers had adapted easily to the new system  but that banks  performance in distributing the new cards had been patchy  at best.  the main issue is that not everyone has the pins they need   said mr clump. nearly two thirds - 65% - of the 1 000 people interviewed said they had used chip and pin to make payments. of these  83% were happy with the experience  though nearly a quarter said they struggled to remember their pin number. however  only 34% said they had received replacement cards with the necessary  chip  technology from all their card providers. furthermore  16% said that none of their cards had been replaced  while 30% said only some had. uk shoppers spent Â£5.3bn on plastic cards in 2003  the last full year for which figures are available from the association of payment clearing services (apacs). altogether  card scams on uk-issued cards totalled Â£402.4m in 2003. card-not-present fraud rose an annual 6% to Â£116.4m  making it the biggest category even then. within this  internet fraud totalled Â£43m  apacs  figures show.,0
business,glazer makes new man utd approach malcolm glazer has made a fresh approach to buy manchester united  which could lead to a bid valuing the premiership club at Â£800m.  the us tycoon  who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months  has approached the united board with  detailed proposals   it has confirmed. mr glazer  who owns the tampa bay buccaneers team  hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. his new offer is expected to contain substantially less debt. mr glazer has already had one takeover attempt turned down by the red devils and responded by using his 28.1% shareholding to vote off three board members last november.  man united had turned down the bid because it was based on a high level of borrowing. but newspapers have speculated recently that the tycoon had gained the support of leading banks to come up with a stronger and less debt-laden bid. last week  however  mr glazer issued a statement to the stock exchange distancing himself from a new bid.  meanwhile  united s chief executive david gill said in december that talks would not resume unless glazer came up with  definitive proposals . now the board has confirmed that the us bidder is back  with a statement issued on sunday reading:  the board can confirm it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various preconditions which may form the basis of an offer.  a further announcement will be made in due course.   to succeed malcolm glazer will still need the approval of major shareholders john magnier and jp mcmanus  who own 28.9% of the club. but the irish duo have cut off talks with glazer over the proposed sale of their stake and have so far made no comment on his latest approach. united fans have reacted with anger at the announcement. they have vehemently opposed any proposed takeover by glazer since he first showed interest in the club in september 2003 and after sunday s announcement they vowed to fight on.  we will fight tooth and nail to stop him whatever his offer says. we do not want him or anybody else taking over united   said mark longden of the independent manchester united supporters  association.  the campaign against this proposed takeover will continue as it has done since glazer first showed interest in the club.,0
sport,mauresmo opens with victory in la amelie mauresmo and maria sharapova won their opening matches at the tour championships in los angeles.  france s mauresmo routed vera zvonareva 6-1 6-0  while wimbledon champion sharapova was a 6-1 6-4 winner over fellow russian svetlana kuznetsova. american serena williams also won  edging russian elena dementieva 7-6 7-5 for her second victory of the event. the event is split into two groups of four with the top two from each advancing to the semi-finals.  mauresmo s win was her ninth in a row as she tries to overtake lindsay davenport for the number one spot. mauresmo spent five weeks at number one after the us open before injury ushered davenport back in front.  since then  i feel very confident on court and my game is there. i want to get the ranking back  but it s very different than before i was number one.  it was an obsession  but now i take it in a relaxed way.  mauresmo completed her first match in the season-ending championship in 54 minutes as russia s zvonareva struggled to return her serve and failed to achieve a single break point.   she got mad a little bit and i played some great tennis   said mauresmo  who was runner-up to kim clijsters in last year s final. zvonareva has lost both her games so far  having crashed 6-2 6-4 kuznetsova in the staples centre on wednesday.  sometimes not everything works   she said.  it was lots of pressure. maybe that is why i couldn t do 100%. but i was fighting.  sharapova  who lost 6-2 6-2 to kuznetsova in beijing in september  said:  in beijing  she was coming off such a big winning streak [14 matches] and she was unstoppable.  this time  it was important to start off well and put some pressure on her.  the tournament debutant added:  i love it here. the atmosphere is great.  to be here where the lakers play  you just feel that excitement. i love basketball.  williams admitted she is still some way off her best form but remained positive after two wins in two days.  it s hard to go out there and get it right but i m fighting and i m hoping   said williams.  what makes me happy is the effort. i had a really good effort today.  i m trying to add new dimensions to my game.,3
politics,opposition grows to house arrests the conservatives have expressed  serious misgivings  about government plans for keeping uk and foreign terror suspects under house arrest.  michael howard said he would not back the home secretary s plans for  control orders  which include home detention.  i do not believe that anyone should be deprived of their liberty on the say so of a politician   he said. the lib dems also oppose the proposals  but ministers insist they are proportionate to the terror threat.  the government proposed the idea and a range of other new powers after the laws lords said current detentions without trial broke human rights laws. new metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair has backed the control orders  saying:  i m sorry. it is a dilemma  but there is only one choice.  but mr howard said:  we have serious misgivings about both their effectiveness in protecting life and their consequences for the british way of life.   he argued that people accused of terrorist offences should be brought to trial and be held in prison - not at home - while they await trial. mr howard said he feared  internment without trial creates martyrs  and could be  a very effective recruiting sergeant  for terrorists . his party plans to move an amendment to the serious organised crime and police bill next week that would give a judge responsibility for assessing evidence and ensuring a balanced case is presented to the court. he called on the prime minister to  enter into constructive discussions  with his party to find a  better way forward . controversy over the issue continues after a foreign terror suspect held in the uk without trial or charge since december 2001 was freed from jail.  home secretary charles clarke said there was not enough evidence to keep the egyptian man  known only as c  certified as a terrorist suspect. on monday  the legal team for two algerian suspects being held without trial told a court the men did not want bail if it meant being put under house arrest. most of the terror suspects are detained at belmarsh prison in london. the liberal democrats say they also oppose house arrests and questioned the human rights implications of the measure. home affairs spokesman mark oaten told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  it s a matter of principle for us that we can t have a situation where the home secretary is able to impose house detention now on uk nationals as well as foreign nationals.   the lib dems believe the home secretary should allow phone tapping evidence in prosecutions.  we think there could be a role for some form of control order - tagging  surveillance  limitation on use of mobile phones - but not with the home secretary s say so. that must be done with a proper judicial process  a judge involved in making those decisions   said mr oaten. mr clarke has rejected that idea saying intercept evidence is only a small part of the case against terror suspects and could put the lives of intelligence sources at risk. he said prosecutions were the government s first preference and promised the powers would only be used in  serious  cases  with independent scrutiny from judges.,2
tech,mobile multimedia slow to catch on there is no doubt that mobile phones sporting cameras and colour screens are hugely popular.  consumers swapping old phones for slinkier  dinkier versions are thought to be responsible for a 26% increase in the number of phones sold during the third quarter of 2004  according to analysts gartner more than 167 million handsets were sold globally between july and september 2004  a period that  according to gartner analyst carolina milanesi is  seldom strong . but although consumers have mobiles that can take and send snaps  sounds and video clips few  so far  are taking the chance to do so.  in fact  the numbers of people not taking and sending pictures  audio and video is growing. figures gathered by continental research shows that 36% of british camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message (mms)  up from 7% in 2003. this is despite the fact that  during the same period  the numbers of camera phones in the uk more than doubled to 7.5 million. getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying. the problem they face  said shailendra jain  head of mms firm adamind  is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets.   also   he said   they have to simplify the interface so its not rocket science in terms of someone understanding it.  research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to. according to continental research  29% of the people it questioned said they were technophobes that tended to shy away from innovation. only 11% regarded themselves as technically savvy enough to send a picture or video message. the fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to people s reluctance to start sending them  said mr jain.  they ask themselves:  if i m streaming video from one handset to another will it work    he said.  there s a lot of user apprehension about that.   there are other deeper technical reasons why multimedia messages are not being pushed as strongly as they might. andrew bud  executive chairman of messaging firm mblox  said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system.  the rate we can send mms into the mobile network is fairly constant   he said. the reason for this is that there are finite capacities for data traffic on the second generation networks that currently have the most users.  no-one wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of mms messages is capped  said mr bud. this has led to operators finding other technologies  particularly one known as wap-push  to get multimedia to their customers. but when networks do find a good way to get multimedia to their customers  the results can be dramatic. israeli technology firm celltick has found a way to broadcast data across phone networks in a way that does not overwhelm existing bandwidth. one of the first firms to use the celltick service is hutch india  the largest mobile firm in the country. the broadcast system gets multimedia to customers via a rolling menu far faster than would be possible with other systems. while not multimedia messaging  such a system gets people used to seeing their phones as a device that can handle all different types of content. as a result 40% of the subscribers to the hutch alive  which uses celltick s broadcast technology  regularly click for more pictures  sounds and images from the operator.  operators really need to start utilising this tool to reach their customers   said yaron toren  spokesman for celltick. until then  multimedia will be a message that is not getting through.,4
sport,disappointed scott in solid start allan scott is confident of winning a medal at next week s european indoor championships after a solid debut on the international circuit.  the 22-year-old scot finished fourth in the 60m hurdles at the jose m cagigal memorial meeting in madrid.  it was definitely a learning curve and i certainly haven t ruled out challenging for a medal next week   said the east kilbride athlete. the race was won by felipe vivancos  who equalled the spanish record.  sweden s robert kronberg was second  with haiti s dudley dorival in third. scott was slightly disappointed with his run in the final. he won his heat in 7.64secs but ran 0.04secs slower in his first iaaf indoor grand prix circuit final.  i should have done better than that   he said.  i felt i could have won it. i got a poor start - but i still felt i should have ran faster.  vivancos slashed his personal best to equal the spanish record with a time of 7.60secs while kronberg and dorival clocked 7.62secs and 7.63secs respectively.,3
politics,howard backs stem cell research michael howard has backed stem cell research  saying it is important people are not frightened of the future.  the controversial issue was a feature of the recent us presidential election  where george bush opposed extending it. but the tory leader argued there was a moral case for embracing science which could help victims of alzheimer s  parkinson s and motor neurone disease.  i believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses   he said. the use of embryonic stem cells in the uk is already allowed. stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the body s tissue types. scientists hope that by growing such cells in the laboratory they can programme them to form specific tissue such as kidney  heart or even brain tissue.  mr howard acknowledged there were genuine concerns about stem cell research. but he argued:  we mustn t be frightened of change or nostalgic about the past - we must be optimistic about the future.  politicians must create the right framework so that the great potential of science can be harnessed for the benefit of mankind.  with the life expectancy of the average briton now around the mid-70s  society has a responsibility to enhance the quality of people s lives as they grow older.  i know many people are concerned about stem-cell research. they are fearful of meddling with what they see as the stuff of souls.  i respect those concerns. but i also believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses like parkinson s  multiple sclerosis  motor neurone disease  alzheimer s and - as we saw in the papers today - now possibly heart problems.   mr howard acknowledged there were  no easy answers  over such an issue but it was necessary to  have the courage to do what we know to be morally right . he added:  of course  stem cells are still a recent discovery. more research needs to be done. but we must look at their potential in a responsible and grown-up way. the hopes of millions of people rest on what could be achieved.  former superman actor the late christopher reeve was an advocate for the research after he was paralysed in a horse riding accident. mr howard made his remarks during a speech in westminster to the conservative national women s committee on ambitions and values.,2
entertainment,belle named  best scottish band  belle & sebastian have been named the best scottish band of all time after a three month-long public poll.  the group beat travis and idlewild into second and third place respectively. franz ferdinand  who recently picked up five brit award nominations  ended up in 15th place  while the eurythmics wound up at a lowly 38. other scottish acts  such as the mull historical society who also featured in the top 50  performed at a party in glasgow where the result was announced. scottish-based band snow patrol  who finished 14th in the vote and have been nominated for a pair of brit awards  were among the performers who covered well-known scottish pop songs at the party on wednesday night.  indie stalwarts belle & sebastian have enjoyed a chart career stretching back to 1997. they were the surprise winners of the brit award for best breakthrough act two years later. scottish bands from earlier musical eras also made it into the final list  including 1970s tartan boy band the bay city rollers and goth favourites the jesus and mary chain.  scottish magazine the list recently compiled a list of the top 50 scottish bands of all time  but left the final decision to the public. the magazine s music editor mark robertson said:  the idea behind the project was simple - to rediscover the very best of scottish music  from the finest musical talent spanning from the age of 70s rock through to 80s pop  right up to today s international stars.   everyone has strong opinions about this and we wanted to open it up to the public to decide   he added. bbc radio scotland presenter vic galloway  who has been involved in the project  said it had been  great fun  to look back at scotland s musical heritage and take note of up-and-coming scottish acts.,1
sport,middlesbrough 2-2 charlton a late header by teenager danny graham earned middlesbrough a battling draw with charlton at the riverside.  matt holland had put the visitors ahead in the 14th minute after his shot took a deflection off franck queudrue. but middlesbrough peppered the charlton goal after the break and chris riggott stroked home the equaliser. shaun bartlett s strike put charlton back in front but that lead lasted just six minutes before graham rushed onto queudrue s pass to head home. the match burst to life from the whistle and charlton defender hermann hreidarsson had sight of an open goal after just six minutes. hreidarsson received danny murphy s free-kick from the right but he crashed his free header wide of the far post. the iceland international looked such a danger the boro bench could be heard issuing frantic instructions to mark him.  charlton s early pressure paid off when bartlett received a long ball from talal el karkouri in the box and laid it off to holland who buried his right-footed strike. szilard nemeth  recalled in place of joseph-desire job  was twice denied his chance to get middlesbrough back on level terms by dean kiely. the striker played a great one-two with jimmy floyd hasselbaink only to see kiely get down well to smother his shot before directing a header straight into the keeper s arms. boro had plenty of time on the ball but the addicks comfortably mopped up the pressure - with kiely tipping a hasselbaink header over the bar - to take their lead into half-time.  it was all one-way traffic after the break at the riverside as middlesbrough poured forward and kiely even saved hreidarsson s blushes when he palmed the ball away to prevent a charlton own goal. but the addicks keeper could do nothing about riggott s equaliser in the 74th minute. the boro defender looked suspiciously offside as he got on the end of gareth southgate s misdirected effort  but despite the charlton protests his goal stood. the addicks did not let their heads drop and bartlett left the boro defence standing  picking up hreidarsson s cross to easily sink his right-footed strike. but substitute graham was on hand to grab a share of the points for the home side. the 19-year-old striker nodding home the equaliser - and his first premiership goal - with five minutes left on the clock.   i felt we did enough to win the game even though the first half was lacklustre.  we dominated after the break  the players showed a fantastic response and we should have gone on to win.  but for (charlton goalkeeper) dean kiely  who made three tremendous saves  we could have scored five or six.    to take the lead and then to get penned back  it feels a little bit like a defeat   admitted kiely.  we were winning but middlesbrough kept knocking on the door. but we stood up and credit to us we didn t capitulate.  we ll kick on now. our short-term ambition is to progress from the seventh place finish from last year.   nash  reiziger (graham 82)  riggott  southgate  queudrue  parlour (job 86)  doriva  nemeth (parnaby 87)  zenden  downing  hasselbaink.  subs not used: cooper  knight.  riggott 74  graham 86.  kiely  hreidarsson  perry  el karkouri  young  konchesky  murphy (euell 78)  holland  kishishev  thomas (johansson 72)  bartlett.  subs not used: fish  jeffers  andersen.  konchesky  hreidarsson  perry.  holland 14  bartlett 80.  29 603  m riley (w yorkshire).,3
sport,ireland 19-13 england ireland consigned england to their third straight six nations defeat with a stirring victory at lansdowne road.  a second-half try from captain brian o driscoll and 14 points from ronan o gara kept ireland on track for their first grand slam since 1948. england scored first through martin corry but had  tries  from mark cueto and josh lewsey disallowed. andy robinson s men have now lost nine of their last 14 matches since the 2003 world cup final. the defeat also heralded england s worst run in the championship since 1987. ireland last won the title  then the five nations  in 1985  but 20 years on they share top spot in the table on maximum points with wales. and eddie o sullivan s side banished the ghosts of 2003 when england were rampant 42-6 victors in claiming the grand slam at lansdowne road. in front of a supercharged home crowd on a dry but blustery day in dublin  ireland tore into the white-shirted visitors from the kick-off and made their intentions clear when o gara landed a fourth-minute drop-goal.  england took their time to settle but their first real venture into ireland s half produced a simple score for corry. the number eight picked up the ball from the back of a ruck and found an absence of green jerseys between himself and the irish line  racing 25 yards to touch down. england fly-half charlie hodgson nailed the conversion from out on the left  but almost immediately o gara  winning his 50th cap  answered with two penalties in quick succession. england were awarded a penalty of their own on the halfway line after 20 minutes  and hodgson  the villain at twickenham  coolly bisected the posts. the first quarter was marked by periods of tactical kicking  but it was ireland who were showing more willingness to spread the ball wide to their eager and inventive backs. a series of probes led by the talismanic o driscoll  back from hamstring injury  resulted in a penalty but ireland chose to kick for touch.  from the line-out  the ball was recycled back to o gara  who stroked his second drop-goal  this time off the right upright. as the interval approached  wing josh lewsey was the catalyst for england s most promising attack. the wasps star raced up his touchline and hodgson s cross-kick put in mark cueto for an apparent score  but the sale wing was ruled to have started in front of the kicker. england began the second half well and had ireland pinned in their own half. but another english indiscretion on a rare irish break-out awarded o gara a kick at goal  which he missed. england s pressure continued  and a wave of attacks saw centre jamie noon dragged down yards from the line before hodgson landed a drop-goal.  the lead was shortlived  however. ireland raced upfield  deft handling from the backs  including a clever dummy from geordan murphy on hodgson  ending with o driscoll going over in the right corner and touching down close to the posts. o gara missed a penalty which would have put ireland nine points clear  and the home crowd breathed a sigh of relief when hodgson s cross-kick was fumbled by lock ben kay near the line. anticipation of a home win sent the noise level sky-high  but o gara missed another chance to seal the game with a wayward drop-goal attempt. inside the last 10 minutes  england poured forward  spurred on by scrum-half matt dawson  who replaced leicester s harry ellis. but despite one near miss with the pack over the line - not checked on the tv replay by referee jonathan kaplan - england were unable to pull off a face-saving win. ireland next face france at lansdowne road in two weeks  time before the potential title decider against wales in cardiff. england are still to meet italy at twickenham  in what is now a wooden spoon decider  and scotland.  g murphy; g dempsey  b o driscoll  s horgan  d hickie; r o gara  p stringer; r corrigan  s byrne  j hayes; m o kelly  p o connell; s easterby  j o connor  a foley.  f sheahan  m horan  d o callaghan  e miller  g easterby  d humphreys  k maggs.  j robinson (capt); m cueto  j noon  o barkley  j lewsey; c hodgson  h ellis; g rowntree  s thompson  m stevens; d grewcock  b kay; j worsley  l moody  m corry.  a titterrell  d bell  s borthwick  a hazell  m dawson  a goode  o smith.,3
sport,hansen  delays return until 2006  british triple jumper ashia hansen has ruled out a comeback this year after a setback in her recovery from a bad knee injury  according to reports.  hansen  the commonwealth and european champion  has been sidelined since the european cup in poland in june 2004. it was hoped she would be able to return this summer  but the wound from the injury has been very slow to heal. her coach aston moore told the times:  we re not looking at any sooner than 2006  not as a triple jumper.  moore said hansen may be able to return to sprinting and long jumping sooner  but there is no short-term prospect of her being involved again in her specialist event.  there was a problem with the wound healing and it set back her rehabilitation by about two months  but that has been solved and we can push ahead now   he said.  the aim is for her to get fit as an athlete - then we will start looking at sprinting and the long jump as an introduction back to the competitive arena.  moore said he is confident hansen can make it back to top-level competition  though it is unclear if that will be in time for the commonwealth games in melbourne next march  when she will be 34.  it s been a frustrating time for her  but it has not fazed her determination   he added.,3
tech,chip maker backs net phone calls rich templeton  the head of giant chip maker texas instruments  has given his backing to the growing sector of voice over internet telephony (voip)  voip allows pc users  and in some cases those with just a broadband connection  to make telephone calls via the net. mr templeton said voip would be the next major application to drive broadband connections into homes. internet service provider wanadoo has announced it is launching its own broadband telephony service in the uk.  subscribers to wanadoo s broadband service will be able to use the service to make free evening and weekend calls to any uk landline  and free calls at any time to other wanadoo users. the service will cost an extra Â£4 a month and will come with a free livebox  the broadband hub which wanadoo plans will be used in future to provide video-on-demand and home security services. the secondary phone line will mean customers can have an extra home phone number and will also provide wireless internet access around the home. eventually the service will replace existing landline services as wanadoo goes head to head with bt.  voice-over broadband is a key trend across europe and is set to have a dramatic impact on the telecommunications industry    eric abensur  wanadoo s chief executive told the bbc news website. mr templeton said he agreed.  voice-over-packet is going to be the second killer application after broadband internet access   he said. the world s largest maker of chips for mobile phones believes the technology will grow rapidly from the relatively small user base it has currently.  almost 83 million people have downloaded the software that powers the skype voip service  according to the net telephony firm s website. skype lets people make free calls to other skype users and also make low-cost calls to ordinary phone numbers. us firm vonage also offers a voip service  but one which lets people plug an ordinary phone into a broadband router to make calls. bill simmelink  general manager of ti s voip business  said the technology would only take off when people were making net calls with the ease of making a normal call.  it s not about the pipe  if you will  or the silicon per se  it s about the application   he said.   we want to communicate freely  effortlessly and economically wherever we are.  in a sign that voip is seeping into the mainstream  giant isp aol announced on tuesday that it had plans to launch a net-based phone service for some of its members within the month. customers will continue to use their traditional phones  but they will plug them into adapters connected to their broadband source rather than the jack provided by the telephone company. calls are received and placed just like on the old telephone network.  we can help mass-market adoption of voip   said aol chief executive jonathan miller.  we can utilise our national footprint. we can help the entire industry become well known.,4
tech,evil twin  fear for wireless net people using wireless high-speed net (wi-fi) are being warned about fake hotspots  or access points.  the latest threat  nicknamed evil twins  pose as real hotspots but are actually unauthorised base stations  say cranfield university experts. once logged onto an evil twin  sensitive data can be intercepted. wi-fi is becoming popular as more devices come with wireless capability. london leads the global wi-fi hotspots league  with more than 1 000. the number of hotspots is expected to reach 200 000 by 2008  according to analysts.  users need to be wary of using their wi-fi enabled laptops or other portable devices in order to conduct financial transactions or anything that is of a sensitive or personal nature   said professor brian collins  head of information systems at cranfield university.   users can also protect themselves by ensuring that their wi-fi device has its security measures activated   he added. bt openzone  which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the uk  told the bbc news website that it made every effort to make its wi-fi secure.  naturally  people may have security concerns   said chris clark  chief executive for bt s wireless broadband.   but wi-fi networks are no more or less vulnerable than any other means of accessing the internet  like broadband or dial-up.  he said bt openzone  as well as others  have sophisticated encryption from the start of the login process to the service at a hotspot.  this means that users  personal information and data  logon usernames and passwords are protected and secure   said mr clark.  in the vast majority of cases  base stations straight out of the box from the manufacturers are automatically set up with the least secure mode possible  said dr nobles. cybercriminals who try to glean personal information using the scam  jam connections to a legitimate base station by sending a stronger signal near to the wireless client. anyone with the right gear can find a real hotspot and substitute it with an evil twin.  cybercriminals don t have to be that clever to carry out such an attack   said dr phil nobles  a wireless net and cybercrime expert at cranfield.  because wireless networks are based on radio signals they can be easily detected by unauthorised users tuning into the same frequency.   although wi-fi is increasing in popularity as more people want to use high-speed net on the move  there have been fears over how secure it is. some companies have been reluctant to use them in large numbers because of fears about security. a wireless network that is not protected can provide a backdoor into a company s computer system. public wi-fi hotspots offered by companies like bt openzone and the cloud  are accessible after users sign up and pay for use. but many home and company wi-fi networks are left unprotected and can be  sniffed out  and hi-jacked by anyone with the correct equipment.  bt advises that customers should change all default settings  make sure that their security settings on all equipment are configured correctly   said mr clark.  we also advocate the use of personal firewalls to ensure that only authorised users can have access and that data cannot be intercepted.  dr nobles is due to speak about wireless cybercrime at the science museum s dana centre in london on thursday.,4
business,gm in crunch talks on fiat future fiat will meet car giant general motors (gm) on tuesday in an attempt to reach agreement over the future of the italian firm s loss-making auto group.  fiat claims that gm is legally obliged to buy the 90% of the car unit it does not already own; gm says the contract  signed in 2000  is no longer valid. press reports have speculated that fiat may be willing to accept a cash payment in return for dropping its claim. both companies want to cut costs as the car industry adjusts to waning demand.  the meeting between fiat boss sergio marchionne and gm s rick wagoner is due to take place at 1330 gmt in zurich  according to the reuters news agency.  mr marchionne is confident of his firm s legal position  saying in an interview with the financial times that gm s argument  has no legs . the agreement in question dates back to gm s decision to buy 20% of fiat s auto division in 2000. at the time  it gave the italian firm the right  via a  put option   to sell the remaining stake to gm. in recent weeks  fiat has reiterated its claims that this  put  is still valid and legally binding. however  gm argues that a fiat share sale made last year  which cut gm s holding to 10%  together with asset sales made by fiat have terminated the agreement.  selling the fiat s car-making unit may not prove so simple  analysts say  especially as it is a company that is so closely linked to italy s industrial heritage. political and public pressure may well push the two firms to reach a compromise.  we are not expecting fiat to exercise its put of the auto business against an unwilling gm at this point   brokerage merrill lynch said in a note to investors  adding that any legal battle would be protracted and damaging to the business.  as far as we are aware  the agnelli family  which indirectly controls at least 30% of fiat  has not given a firm public indication that it wants to sell the auto business.  fiat may be willing to cancel the  put  in exchange for money.,0
business,metlife buys up citigroup insurer us banking giant citigroup has sold its travelers life & annuity insurance arm to metlife for $11.5bn (Â£6.1bn).  the sale is a further move by citigroup away from its 1990s strategy of offering every financial service - insurance  broking and banking. profit growth in the insurance market has not matched expansion at citigroup s other businesses. for metlife  the us s leading insurance company  the purchase gives it access to a much larger distribution network.  robert benmosche  metlife s chairman and chief executive  said that it was a  great opportunity for the brand of metlife to be distributed through citigroup . under the agreement  metlife will be able to sell its products through citigroup over the next 10 years. the deal includes smith barney retail brokerages and citibank branches. the company will pay between $1bn and $3bn in metlife stock with the rest being made up of cash. travelers had sales of $5.2bn in 2004 and made a profit of $901m. it has total net assets of $96bn.  this deal employs some of metlife s excess capital in a potentially higher-return business and gives it more distribution   said stuart quint  an analyst at gartmore.,0
business,quiksilver moves for rossignol shares of skis rossignol  the world s largest ski-maker  have jumped as much as 15% on speculation that it will be bought by us surfwear firm quiksilver.  the owners of rossignol  the boix-vives family  are said to be considering an offer from quiksilver. analysts believe other sporting goods companies may now take a closer look at rossignol  prompting an auction and pushing the sale price higher. nike and k2 have previously been mentioned as possible suitors.  rossignol shares touched 17.70 euros  before falling back to trade 7.8% higher at 16.60 euros. european sporting goods companies have seen foreign revenues squeezed by a slump in the value of the us dollar  making a takeover more attractive  analysts said. companies such as quiksilver would be able to cut costs by selling rossignol skis through their shops  they added. the boix-vives family is thought to have spent the past couple of years sounding out possible suitors for rossignol  which also makes golf equipment  snowboards and sports clothing.,0
politics,brown shrugs off economy fears gordon brown is to freeze petrol duty increases  fund a Â£1bn package to avoid big council tax rises and boost childcare and maternity leave.  in an upbeat pre-budget report  he slightly increased borrowing but insisted economic targets would be met. the chancellor also hailed the longest period of growth in uk  industrial history  but denied he was  gloating . but oliver letwin  for the tories  attacked government red tape and debt  dubbing mr brown  sir wastealot .  the shadow chancellor said mr brown s  golden rule  had  turned to dross in his hands  and said he was borrowing to spend  not invest  with predicted debt over the coming years totalling Â£170bn. mr letwin told mps:  the tide is going out on the chancellor s credibility. he is spending  borrowing and taxing so much because he is not getting value for taxpayer s money.   vincent cable  for the liberal democrats  accused mr brown of ducking tough choices.  he said:  last week the prime minister gave us the politics of fear; this week the chancellor has offered the economics of complacency.  there are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the uk housing market and rising personal debt. but they have not been confronted.  mr brown rejected the lib dem s call to open up the government s books to the national audit office  saying decisions on tax and spending should be made by ministers. some economists say his forecasts on public finances are wishful thinking. bbc economic editor evan davis said the figures were plausible but also a gamble.  mr brown s insistence he was not  gloating  was a pointed rebuttal of a warning from new european commissioner peter mandelson. in his speech  he set out a 10-year childcare strategy for if labour wins the next election.  it includes a Â£285m cash injection to extend paid maternity leave from six months to nine  with parents able to transfer leave from the mother to the father. he also promised to increase free nursery education for three and four-year-olds to 15 hours from april 2007. and funds would be provided to keep schools open from 0800 to 1800gmt to look after children while their parents were at work. taken together  the measures would create a  welfare state that is truly family-friendly for the first time in its history   said mr brown. he also announced a cash hand-out for older pensioners  with payments of Â£50 for the over-70s as part of the winter fuel allowance. in a move ministers say should keep council tax rises below 5% next year  the chancellor said he was providing an extra Â£1bn for local councils. the money is expected to come from government departments such as health and education.  mr brown said he was set to meet his two fiscal rules - to borrow only to invest and keep debt  low and sustainable  - both in this economic cycle and the next. borrowing figures for 2003/4 are Â£35bn - Â£2.5bn less than the Â£37.5bn predicted in march s budget  as already announced by the office for national statistics. borrowing is tipped to fall to Â£31bn by 2005/06 - but that is still Â£2bn more than mr brown predicted in his march budget. inflation would be 1.75% next year and 2% in the years to follow  mr brown forecast. he also pledged an extra Â£105m for security and counter-terrorism. business groups have welcomed efforts to improve competitiveness and invest more in skills and innovation. but there worries about the costs of more family-friendly working. simon sweetman  from the federation of small businesses  said:  the proposals on maternity leave have clearly been made with a general election in mind and with little thought to the impact on small employers.,2
tech,pandas benefit from wireless net the world s dwindling panda population is getting a helping hand from a wireless internet network.  the wolong nature reserve in the sichuan province of southwest china is home to 20% of the remaining 1 500 giant pandas in the world. a broadband and wireless network installed on the reserve has allowed staff to chronicle the pandas  daily activities. the data and images can be shared with colleagues around the world. the reserve conducts vital research on both panda breeding and bamboo ecology.  using the network  vets have been able to observe how infant pandas feed and suggest changes to improve the tiny cubs  chances of survival.   digital technology has transformed the way we communicate and share information inside wolong and with the rest of the world   said zhang hemin  director of the wolong nature reserve.  our researchers now have state-of-the-art digital technology to help foster the panda population and manage our precious surroundings.  the network has been developed by intel  working closely with the staff at wolong. it includes a 802.11b wireless network and a video monitoring system using five cameras to observe pandas around the clock.  before the new infrastructure arrived at the panda park  staff walked or drove to deliver floppy disks across the reserve. infant panda health was recorded on paper notebooks and research teams in the field had little access to the data. to foster cultural links across the globe  a children s learning lab has been incorporated in the network  in collaboration with globio (federation for global biodiversity education for children)  an international non-profit organisation. it will enable children at local primary schools to hook up with their peers in portland  oregon in the us.  digital technology brings this story to life by enabling a global dialogue to help bridge cultures around the world   said globio founder gerry ellis.,4
tech,millions buy mp3 players in us one in 10 adult americans - equivalent to 22 million people - owns an mp3 player  according to a survey.  a study by the pew internet and american life project found that mp3 players are the gadget of choice among affluent young americans. the survey did not interview teenagers but it is likely that millions of under-18s also have mp3 players. the american love affair with digital music players has been made possible as more and more homes get broadband.  of the 22 million americans who own mp3 players  59% are men compared to 41% of women. those on high income - judged to be $75 000 (Â£39 000) or above - are four times more likely to have players than those earning less than $30  000 ( Â£15 000). broadband access plays a big part in ownership too. almost a quarter of those with broadband at home have players  compared to 9% of those who have dial-up access. mp3 players are still the gadget of choice for younger adults. almost one in five us citizens aged under 30 have one. this compares to 14% of those aged 30-39 and 14% of those aged 40-48. the influence of children also plays a part. sixteen percent of parents living with children under 18 have digital players compared to 9% of those who don t. the ease of use and growth of music available on the net are the main factors for the upsurge in ownership  the survey found. people are beginning to use them as instruments of social activity - sharing songs and taking part in podcasting - the survey found.  ipods and mp3 players are becoming a mainstream technology for consumers  said lee rainie  director of the pew internet and american life project.  more growth in the market is inevitable as new devices become available  as new players enter the market  and as new social uses for ipods/mp3 players become popular   he added.,4
entertainment,us critics laud comedy sideways road trip comedy sideways has had more praise heaped on it by two us critics  associations  adding to honours it has already picked up.  the chicago film critics association (cfca) named it winner in five categories including best film and best actor for paul giamatti. but the director award went to clint eastwood for million dollar baby. the southeastern film critics also awarded sideways its best film of the year accolade. director alexander payne was named best director  and he also won best screenplay shared with jim taylor. the cfca awarded thomas haden church the best supporting actor prize and virginia madsen the best supporting actress award for their roles in the film.  sideways has already been voted best film by critics associations in new york and los angeles and has been nominated for a golden globe. british actress imelda staunton won the cfca best actress for the gritty abortion drama vera drake  adding to a growing list of awards she has won for her performance in the mike leigh film. scrubs star zach braff was named best new director for his debut garden state. michael moore s controversial documentary fahrenheit 9/11 won the best documentary  while a very long engagement won best foreign film. the chicago critics have yet to name a date for when their awards ceremony will be held.,1
business,dollar drops on reserves concerns the us dollar has dropped against major currencies on concerns that central banks may cut the amount of dollars they hold in their foreign reserves.  comments by south korea s central bank at the end of last week have sparked the recent round of dollar declines. south korea  which has about $200bn in foreign reserves  said it plans instead to boost holdings of currencies such as the australian and canadian dollar. analysts reckon that other nations may follow suit and now ditch the dollar. at 1300 gmt  the euro was up 0.9% on the day at 1.3187 euros per us dollar. the british pound had added 0.5% to break through the $1.90 level  while the dollar had fallen by 1.3% against the japanese yen to trade at 104.16 yen.  at the start of the year  the us currency  which had lost 7% against the euro in the final three months of 2004 and had fallen to record lows  staged something of a recovery.  analysts  however  pointed to the dollar s inability recently to extend that rally despite positive economic and corporate data  and highlighted the fact that many of the us s economic problems had not disappeared. the focus once again has been on the country s massive trade and budget deficits  with predictions of more dollar weakness to come.  the comments from korea came at a time when sentiment towards the dollar was already softening   said ian gunner  a trader at mellon financial. on tuesday  traders in asia said that both south korea and taiwan had withdrawn their bids to buy dollars at the start of the session. mansoor mohi-uddin  chief currency strategist at ubs  said that there was a sentiment in the market that  central banks from asia and the middle east are buying euros . a report last month already showed that the dollar was losing its allure as a currency that offered rock-steady returns and stability. compiled by central banking publications and sponsored by the uk s royal bank of scotland  the survey found 39 nations out of 65 questioned were increasing their euro holdings  with 29 cutting back on the us dollar.,0
politics,blunkett row should end - blair prime minister tony blair said it was time to draw a line under the controversy surrounding david blunkett.  the tories and the lib dems have called for a second inquiry into the fast-tracking of a visa application for mr blunkett s ex-lover s nanny. sir alan budd found a  chain of events  linked mr blunkett to leoncia casalme s indefinite leave to remain application. at the end of his middle east trip  mr blair said he still admired mr blunkett and thought his integrity was intact.  on tuesday sir alan said the application for leave to remain in the uk made by kimberly quinn s nanny was processed in 52 days  120 days faster than the average. but he could not find evidence to show whether mr blunkett s intervention was intended to give special help for his then lover s nanny - or if he was raising the case as an example of poor departmental performance. in his first comments since sir alan s announcement  mr blair told bbc news he had not yet read the report in detail. but told bbc news:  as far as i m concerned  we have drawn a line under that.   asked if mr blunkett could return to frontline politics at some point  he replied:  i have made my admiration for david very clear and it remains.  he s been a tremendous colleague  he s done a great job for us  first as home secretary then as education secretary. the future is something we will have to approach in the future.  the prime minister shrugged off claims from conservative leader michael howard that he led a  grubby government . he said mr blunkett s integrity remained intact:  he was the person first of all who asked for this inquiry to be set up. he accepted that what he originally thought had happened had not happened  he said.  but i think sir alan budd also accepted there wasn t some conspiracy or cover-up and i just think a line should be drawn under now and we should move on.   earlier  mr howard said:  there does need to be another inquiry  a judge-led inquiry. there were so many questions that weren t answered.  there was  deceit at the heart of government  which was not limited to the visa affair  he argued. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten also said there was  a strong case for a judge-led judicial review .  he said:  next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa. it may be about something even more important than that.  mr blunkett quit as home secretary last week after being told in advance of sir alan s findings. in a statement  the ex-home secretary said he accepted the inquiry s findings. he said he had told the truth throughout and had raised the nanny case as an example of unacceptable backlogs in the system.,2
business,euronext joins bid battle for lse pan-european stock market euronext has approached the london stock exchange (lse) about a possible takeover bid.   the approach is at an early stage and therefore does not require a response at this point   lse said. talks with the european stock market and with rival bidder deutsche boerse will continue  the lse said. last week  the group rejected a Â£1.3bn ($2.5bn) takeover offer from deutsche boerse  claiming that it undervalued the business. lse saw its shares surge 4.9% to a new high of 583p in early trade  following the announcement on monday.  the offer follows widespread media speculation that euronext would make an offer for lse. experts now widely expect a bidding war for europe s biggest stock market  which lists stocks with a total capitalisation of Â£1.4 trillion  to break out. commentators say that a deal with euronext  which owns the liffe derivatives exchange in london and combines the paris  amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges  could potentially offer the lse more cost savings than a deal with deutsche boerse.  a weekend report in the telegraph had quoted an unnamed executive at euronext as saying the group would make a cash bid to trump deutsche boerse s offer.  because we already own liffe in london  the cost savings available to us from a merger are far greater than for deutsche boerse   the newspaper quoted the executive as saying. euronext chief executive jean-francois theodore is reported to have already held private talks with lse s chief executive clara furse. further reports had suggested that euronext could make an offer in excess of the lse s 533p a share closing price on friday. however  euronext said it could not guarantee  at this stage  that a firm offer would be made for lse. there has been extensive speculation about a possible takeover of the company since an attempted merger with deutsche boerse failed in 2000.,0
business,christmas shoppers flock to tills shops all over the uk reported strong sales on the last saturday before christmas with some claiming record-breaking numbers of festive shoppers.  a spokesman for manchester s trafford centre said it was  the biggest christmas to date  with sales up 5%. and the regent street association said shops in central london were also expecting the  best christmas ever . that picture comes despite reports of disappointing festive sales in the last couple of weeks.  the trafford centre spokeswoman said about 8 500 thousand vehicles had arrived at the centre on saturday before 1130 gmt.  we predict that the next week will continue the same trend   she added.  it was a similar story at bluewater in kent. spokesman alan jones said he expected 150 000 shoppers to have visited by the end of saturday and a further 100 000 on sunday.  our sales so far have been 2% up on the same time last year   he said.  we re very busy  it s really strong and people will be shopping right up until christmas.  over the christmas period we re expecting people to spend in excess of Â£200m at the centre.   on saturday afternoon  a spokeswoman for the st david s shopping centre in cardiff said it looked like being its busiest day of the year with about 200 000 shoppers expected to have visited by the close of play. at the st enoch s shopping centre in glasgow  more than 140 000 shoppers - an all-time record - were expected to have passed through the doors by its closing time of 1900 gmt. senior business manager jon walton said:  it has been phenomenal - absolutely mobbed.  every week footfall has been showing strong growth and at the weekends it has been going mad.  regent street association director annie walker said on saturday:  the stores were heaving today and a lot of people are going to be doing last minute shopping as many people finished work on friday and can go in the week.   she said reports of a slump in pre-christmas sales were related to the growing popularity of internet sales.  i do think this has had a lot to do with reports of lower sales figures   she said.  internet shopping has gone up enormously and not all stores have websites.,0
business,giving financial gifts to children your child or grandchild may want the latest toy this christmas  but how about giving them a present that will help their financial future   gifts of the financial variety might have a longer lasting impact. it may encourage children to save or start a fund which could count towards university costs  for example.  the government is trying to encourage saving at an early age  through its new child trust fund. the first vouchers  worth Â£250 or Â£500 for low-income families  will be distributed from january. all children born after 1st september 2002 will be eligible. parents will need to decide which financial institution will manage this gift in time for the start of the scheme in april 2005.  parents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to Â£1 200 a year  which will grow free of income and capital gains tax. as the child trust fund will not be in force in time for christmas  relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children s deposit account  and use this as a feeder fund.  there are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay a higher rate of interest. some of the best instant-access accounts currently available include the ladybird account from the saffron walden building society  paying 5.35% for a minimum balance of Â£1 and the alliance & leicester firstsaver which pays 5.25%  also starting at Â£1.  interest earned by children is subject to income tax. however  children  like adults  have a personal income tax allowance (Â£4 745 for the current tax year).  if the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives - but not parents - any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance. as long as the total amount of interest falls within the allowance  then no tax will be payable. when the account is opened a form  r85   available from the bank or building society  should be completed. this confirms that the account holder is a non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax.  the tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child. only Â£100 of interest (per parent) can be tax-free. where interest exceeds this level  the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent. this is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children s names and taking advantage of the tax allowances. where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of a child  consideration should be given to opening separate accounts - one for parents  gifts and one for gifts from other relatives. therefore  it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the child trust fund which is tax free  with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual Â£1 200 limit being directed to a deposit account.  another favourite solution is premium bonds. with the promise of riches far greater than a mere deposit account  they make great presents. the parent or guardian will be responsible for the bonds and will receive notification of the purchase. any prizes will be sent to the parent or child s guardian. the minimum for each purchase is Â£100 and bonds are sold in multiples of Â£10.  there are gift opportunities beyond cash accounts and these should not be ignored.  over the longer term  stock market funds have outperformed other types of investment  although in the shorter term they can be volatile. one of the benefits of investing for children is that investment is generally for the longer term - more than ten years - which helps to reduce the risks associated with investing in shares. one way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through a unit or investment trust. these are pooled investment funds which give access to a wide range of shares. these funds may be actively managed  where a fund manager picks individual stocks based on a view of their future potential  or passive  where a manager invests in all the shares that comprise a stock market index  for example  the ftse 100. exchange traded funds offer an alternative way to track a stock market. these are single shares that give the return of an underlying index (so are really another form of tracker). the difference is that the charges are quite low. the only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age 18  and parents will have no control over how it is spent. for larger gifts it may be worthwhile taking professional advice on the establishment of a suitable trust that will allow ongoing control over the capital and income.,0
tech,apple attacked over sources row civil liberties group the electronic frontier foundation (eff) has joined a legal fight between three us online journalists and apple.  apple wants the reporters to reveal 20 sources used for stories which leaked information about forthcoming products  including the mac mini. the eff  representing the reporters  has asked california s superior court to stop apple pursuing the sources. it argues that the journalists are protected by the american constitution. the eff says the case threatens the basic freedoms of the press.  apple is particularly keen to find the source for information about an unreleased product code-named asteroid and has asked the journalists  e-mail providers to hand over communications relevant to that.  rather than confronting the issue of reporter s privilege head-on  apple is going to the journalist s isps for his e-mails   said eff lawyer kurt opsahl.  this undermines a fundamental first amendment right that protects all reporters.  if the court lets apple get away with this  and exposes the confidences gained by these reporters  potential confidential sources will be deterred from providing information to the media and the public will lose a vital outlet for independent news  analysis and commentary   he said. the case began in december 2004 when apple asked a local californian court to get the journalists to reveal their sources for articles published on websites appleinsider.com and powerpage.org.  apple also sent requested information from the nfox.com  the internet service provider of powerpage s publisher jason o-grady. as well as looking at how far corporations can go in preventing information from being published  the case will also examine whether online journalists have the same privileges and protections as those writing for newspapers and magazines. the eff has gained some powerful allies in its legal battle with apple  including professor tom goldstein  former dean of the journalism school at the university of california and dan gillmor  a well-known silicon valley journalist. apple was not immediately available for comment.,4
business,lse  sets date for takeover deal  the london stock exchange (lse) is planning to announce a preferred takeover by the end of the month  newspaper reports claim.  the sunday telegraph said the lse s plan was further evidence it wants to retain tight control over its destiny. both deutsche boerse and rival euronext held talks with the london market last week over a possible offer. a Â£1.3bn offer from deutsche boerse has already been rejected  while euronext has said it will make an all cash bid. speculation suggests that paris-based euronext has the facilities in place to make a bid of Â£1.4bn  while its german rival may up its bid to the Â£1.5bn mark. neither has yet tabled a formal bid  but the lse is expected to hold further talks with the two parties later this week. however  the sunday telegraph report added that there are signs that deutsche boerse chief executive werner seifert is becoming increasingly impatient with the lse s managed bid process.  despite insisting he wants to agree a recommended deal with the lse s board  the newspaper suggested he may pull out of the process and put an offer directly to shareholders instead. the newspaper also claimed mr seifert was becoming  increasingly frustrated  with the pace of negotiations since deutsche boerse s Â£1.3bn offer was rejected in mid-december  in particular the lse s decision to suspend talks over the christmas period. meanwhile  the german exchange s offer has come under fire recently. unions for deutsche boerse staff in frankfurt have reportedly expressed fears that up to 300 jobs would be moved to london if the takeover is successful. others claim it will weaken the city s status as europe s financial centre  while german politicians are also said to be angry over the market operator s promise to move its headquarters to london if a bid is successful. a further stumbling block is deutsche boerse s control over its clearstream unit  the clearing house that processes securities transactions. lse shareholders fear it would create a monopoly situation  weakening the position of shareholders when negotiating lower transaction fees for share dealings. lse and euronext do not have control over their clearing and settlement operations  a situation which critics say is more transparent and competitive.,0
sport,castaignede fires laporte warning former france fly-half thomas castaignede has warned the pressure is mounting on coach bernard laporte following their defeat by wales.  france suffered a shock loss against the welsh at the weekend after looking on course for an easy win. castaignede told bbc sport:  the pressure is big on laporte after a huge loss to new zealand  a slim win over scotland and a miracle against england.  but the french have to get behind him and the team at lansdowne road.  following victories over south africa and australia in november  france were deemed by many to be the world s leading side. but they were then trounced 45-6 by new zealand and only just beat scotland after the scots had a try disallowed in their six nations opener. it then took some woeful spot kicking from charlie hodgson and olly barkley to help them to victory against england at twickenham. &lt;  castaignede said:  you can t say any of those results have eased the pressure on laporte.  had england s kickers not been so bad  the position in the six nations would be very different now.  laporte has been criticised for france s negative tactics in their wins over scotland and england. but his side played a more free-flowing style against wales  making a mockery of the opposition s defence in the first half before suffering a shock turnaround in fortunes after the interval.  all the chat in france has been about how france will play against ireland   said castaignede ahead of the 12 march tie.  everyone wants to see the sort of play we saw against wales. but everyone also wants a win.  castaignede  a veteran of 43 international caps  admitted the french would go in as underdogs against ireland.   going to ireland is never easy but the way they re playing right now  it s harder than ever   said castaignede.  they re very experienced and don t often lose at home. they ve got some great forwards and some electric runners on the break.  despite praising the irish he claimed the welsh had the upper hand in the six nations run-in.  ireland have such a good pack but wales are something else on the break   he added.  at the weekend they were simply awesome. as a frenchman it was disappointing to see  but you had to admire it.  their commitment to every cause can make them win this championship.  the 30-year-old also tipped yann delaigue to start ahead of frederic michalak at number 10 after an impressive display in paris last weekend.  delaigue played really well and admittedly michalak played well too   said castaignede.  i m just glad i m not the one who has to make the decision.,3
business,bmw cash to fuel mini production less than four years after the new mini was launched  german car maker bmw has announced Â£100m of new investment.  some 200 new jobs are to be created at the oxford factory  including modernised machinery and a new body shell production building. the result of the investment could be to raise output to more than 200 000 cars from 2007. the rise  from 189 000 last year  is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists. before wednesday s announcement  bmw had invested some Â£280m in mini production.  since its launch during summer 2001  the new mini has gone from strength to strength.  last year  almost one in six cars sold by the bmw group was a mini. the company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry.  our decision to produce a new mini was not received well right away   said norbert reithofer  a member of the bmw management board. initially  bmw said it would produce 100 000 mini models a year at its vast cowley factory on the outskirts of oxford  but the target was quickly reached  then raised  time and time again. not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue.  the risk is that after they ve invested massively in the brand  demand tapers off like it did with the new vw beetle   said brad wernle  from automotive news europe.  the price of the car has also gone up. when it was launched  the cheapest mini cost just more than Â£10 000. these days  buyers will have to fork out almost Â£11 500 to own a new mini one  or even more for the cooper s which costs up to Â£17 730. the mini convertible  which was launched last spring  costs up to Â£15 690 for the top model  and there is even a waiting list. second-hand minis are not cheap either. a mini one bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least Â£8 000 for the cheapest model  while a used cooper s is likely to be priced from Â£12 556  according to the-car buying website parker s. the consumers  association which operates with slightly different numbers  yet it confirms that the mini cooper 1.6 depreciates slower than any other car  other than the mercedes benz c180 se and the bmw 1 series 116i se.  the cowley factory  which initially seemed far too large a production plant for just 100 000 minis  is increasingly being put to good use.  there are plans to tear down old buildings and build new ones and there are rumours that a new paint shop could be included in the plans. bmw s mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the uk car maker rover which it sold for Â£10 five years ago to the phoenix consortium. in 1999  when bmw still owned rover  the oxford factory was producing the award-winning rover 75. during that year  3 500 people produced 56 000 cars. last year  in the same factory  almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4 500 mini-workers. the mini factory s current output is equally impressive when compared with the main rover factory in longbridge  which in 1999 produced 180 000 rover cars. last year  mg rover  which employs more than 6 000 people  produced just 110 000 cars  though it hopes to land a deal with shanghai automotive industry corporation (saic) that could help double the number of cars produced at longbridge. indeed  mini is not only producing more cars than mg rover does; it remains ahead even when the current sales of land rovers and range rovers (which are made by the former rover unit that bmw sold to ford) are taken into account.,0
business,five million germans out of work germany s unemployment figure rose above the psychologically important level of five million last month.  on wednesday  the german federal labour agency said the jobless total had reached 5.037 million in january  which takes the jobless rate to 12.1%.  yes  we have effectively more than five million people unemployed   a government minister said earlier on zdf public television. unemployment has not been this high in germany since the 1930s.  changes to the way the statistics are compiled partly explain the jump of 572 900 in the numbers. but the figures are embarrassing for the government.  with the figures apparently the worst we ve seen in the post-war period  these numbers are very charged politically   said christian jasperneite  an economist with mm warburg.  they could well put an end to the recent renaissance we ve seen by the spd [the ruling social democrats] in the polls  and with state elections due in schleswig-holstein and north rhine-westphalia  they may have an adverse effect on the government s chances there.   the opposition also made political capital from the figures. it said there are a further 1.5 million-2 million people on subsidised employment schemes who are  in fact  looking for real jobs. it added that government reforms  including unpopular benefit cuts  do not go far enough. under the government s controversial  hartz iv  reforms  which came into effect at the beginning of the year  both those on unemployment benefits and welfare support and those who are long-term unemployed are officially classified as looking for work. the bad winter weather also took its toll  as key sectors such as the construction sector laid off workers. adjusted for the seasonal factors  the german jobless total rose by 227 000 in january from december.,0
politics,police urge pub closure power new powers are needed to close disorderly pubs  bars and clubs for up to a week or even permanently  police chiefs have told mps.  association of chief police officers president chris fox said the current 24-hour closure power did not have enough impact on bad landlords. mr fox s comments follow the controversy over plans to allow pubs to open around the clock. he rejected critics  calls for the law change to be delayed. instead  the new licensing act could help reduce drunken disorder - but only if it was properly planned  he argued.  acpo made its call for stronger closure powers in a paper for the commons home affairs select committee. after the meeting  mr fox said being able to close premises for only 24 hours did not necessarily make an impact.  if it s 12.30 on a saturday morning and you close for 24 hours there s not a lot of pain for the premises because they probably wouldn t open on sunday anyway.   this is about getting through to the management that they can t run a disorderly house without facing some immediate sanctions.  under acpo s proposal  the closure orders would be used only with the agreement of the local licensing authority. the new licensing laws will give police greater powers to close pubs and clubs - but only for 24-hour periods.  mr fox said the drinks industry was currently not regulating itself.  it s making money at the cost of human misery and the public purse  and the strategic planning process has been less than useless   he said. mr fox said the new laws  due to start being phased in next month  could help if food outlets  public transport and public toilets could cope with late-night drinkers.  staggering it (closing hours) will be a solution if the infrastructure is there  if the premises are properly managed and people aren t being served rolling drunk and underage and then tossed out into the street   he said.  we have the problem from 11pm to 2am in any event. we have to get a grip on the underlying causes of this.   acpo wants pubs and clubs which cause extra work for police and hospitals to have to pay towards the costs. home secretary charles clarke is currently looking at the idea of a levy on the drinks industry to pay for the cost of extra policing. the licensing changes have sparked concern among some mps  councils and some senior police officers who fear they could exacerbate drinking problems. culture secretary tessa jowell on tuesday said it was not her job to bow to the campaign against the changes. it was the status quo  not the new laws  which were causing current binge drinking problems  she told bbc two s newsnight. leaked documents have suggested ex-home secretary david blunkett branded new opening hours as a  leap in the dark . but ms jowell insisted his concerns had been met. the police s job against alcohol-related crime would be made easier if all pubs did not close at the same time  she added.,2
entertainment,beatles suits sell for $110 000 four suits worn by the beatles on their please please me album cover have sold for $110 00 (Â£59 000) at a us auction.  but some of elvis presley s earliest recordings - including takes of all shook up - failed to sell at the bonhams and butterfields two-day sale. a private collection of six tape recordings of presley valued at between $30 000 (Â£16 000) and $50 000 (Â£27 000) did not meet their reserve price. a signed presley photograph managed to fetch $2 115 (Â£1 140).  auction spokesman erik simon said the presley tapes were withdrawn because  they did not meet the minimum price set by the owners .  he said the family of sound engineer thorne nogar did not want to divulge the price they had set or the offers they had received. the rca tapes date from september 1956 to september 1957. the  pre-masters  include a take of jailhouse rock  religious songs  material for his first christmas album  and banter between presley  members of his band and mr nogar.   we ve had them for a lot of years  and i think the people should enjoy them. and frankly  we could use the money   mr nogar s son stephen  57  said before the auction. mr nogar  who died in 1994 aged 72  always used to make two tapes of sessions as a back-up in case rca producers wanted to make late changes to songs.  he called them his  ass-saver  tapes   his son said. the quality is said to be noticeably crisper than that of a new vinyl record. because the family does not own the copyright to the music  the tapes could only be sold for  personal enjoyment  and cannot be copied for commercial gain. the auction made a total of $1.1m (Â£600 000).,1
business,m&s cuts prices by average of 24% marks & spencer has cut prices in london and the regions by an average of 24%  according to research from a city investment bank.  dresdner kleinwort wasserstein said:  in spite of the snow in the uk  it still feels very early to be cutting prices of spring merchandise.  stuart rose  head of m&s  said last year its prices were too high.  we are bringing in ranges at new price points to compete against mid-market retailers like next   said m&s.  next is one of m&s s biggest competitors and the move may force it to lower prices. drkw said the cuts are either to clear stock or could indicate a longer term  step change in pricing in certain areas  at m&s.  either way  this cannot be good news for m&s  margin   it added.  we have brought in quite a lot of new clothing at new price points as part of stuart rose s strategy of quality  style -and price   said the m&s spokesman. many analysts believe february is proving to be a difficult month for retailers and british retail consortium figures  due in a few weeks  are expected to reflect the tough trading environment. separately  investment bank goldman sachs produced reseach showing that a basket of 35 m&s goods is now 11% above the high-street average  compared with 43% higher last year.  it has been a strange week for m&s  which on tuesday received a statement from philip green  the billionaire bhs owner  confirming he was not rebidding for the company. this was followed the same day by mark paulsmeier  a south african financier  issuing a press release saying his paulsmeier group was interested in m&s. a sudden spike in m&s s share price followed. however  an m&s spokesman said on sunday it had no evidence that mr paulsmeier had lined up sufficient finance for a bid. he also said the takeover panel and the uk s financial watchdog the financial services authority had been in touch with m&s at the beginning of the week to find out what it knew about the paulsmeier developments.,0
entertainment,public show for reynolds portrait sir joshua reynolds  portrait of omai will get a public airing following fears it would stay hidden because of an export wrangle.  the tate gallery unsuccessfully tried to buy the picture from its anonymous owner after a ban was issued preventing the painting from leaving the uk. the 18th century painting has remained in storage but the owner has agreed to allow it to be part of an exhibition. the exhibition of reynolds  work will be shown at tate britain from may. joshua reynolds: the creation of celebrity will feature prints  caricatures  and sculpture by the 18th century artist  who painted some of the most famous personalities of his day. portrait of omai fetched the second highest amount for a british painting when it was sold at auction for Â£10.3m in 2001. it was bought by a london dealer who sold it on to a collector. the unnamed collector wanted to take it out of the country  but was barred from doing so by the government because of its historical significance.  in march 2004  the tate managed to raise Â£12.5m funding to buy the portrait but the owner refused to sell and it has been held in storage since. the portrait is of a young man who was dubbed  the noble savage  when he arrived in london from polynesia. he became a darling of london society and was invited to all the best parties by people who were fascinated by such an exotic character. sir joshua painted him after his arrival in 1774  and it became the artist s most famous work after it was first exhibited at the royal academy in 1776.,1
business,bush to get  tough  on deficit us president george w bush has pledged to introduce a  tough  federal budget next february in a bid to halve the country s deficit in five years.  the us budget and its trade deficit are both deep in the red  helping to push the dollar to lows against the euro and fuelling fears about the economy. mr bush indicated there would be  strict discipline  on non-defence spending in the budget. the vow to cut the deficit had been one of his re-election declarations. the federal budget deficit hit a record $412bn (Â£211.6bn) in the 12 months to 30 september and $377bn in the previous year.   we will submit a budget that fits the times   mr bush said.  it will provide every tool and resource to the military  will protect the homeland  and meet other priorities of the government.  the us has said it is committed to a strong dollar. but the dollar s weakness has hit european and asian exporters and lead to calls for us intervention to boost the currency. mr bush  however  has said the best way to halt the dollar s slide is to deal with the us deficit.  it s a budget that i think will send the right signal to the financial markets and to those concerned about our short-term deficits   mr bush added.  as well  we ve got to deal with the long-term deficit issues.,0
sport,wales make two changes for france wales coach mike ruddock has made two changes from the team that beat italy 38-8 for saturday s trip to france.  kevin morgan takes over from his injured newport-gwent dragons colleague hal luscombe on the right wing. and in the pack neath-swansea ospreys forward ryan jones is preferred at blindside flanker to jonathan thomas. thomas  a try-scorer in rome  drops down to the bench instead of ian gough  while cardiff back rhys williams steps up in place of morgan. luscombe is sidelined by a hamstring problem sustained during the six nations game against italy last weekend.  however  the experienced and in-form morgan was already pushing hard for a start at stade de france.  due to his impressive performances from the bench  kevin was very much in the selection mix anyway  and the unfortunate injury to hal gives him the chance to start   said ruddock.  now that ryan jones has recovered from injury  we have increased the options in the back row.  jonathan thomas is unlucky to lose his spot after performing well against italy and scoring a try  but such is the competition for places that every position is debated in detail.  for this particular game  we felt we might not always be afforded the open spaces out wide we were able to exploit against italy  so an extra big ball-carrier in the back-row is thought to be necessary on this occasion.  obviously  it s a 22-man game these days  and there is every chance that jonathan will be making an impact from the bench.  wales have beaten france on two of their last three visits to paris  and another victory this time around would keep them firmly on course for a first five or six nations title triumph since 1994.  graham henry (former wales coach) said a couple of years ago that we should  be bold  when going to france  and he was proved right   said ruddock.  that is a great way to approach the game  and something we will further endorse with the players this week.   g thomas (toulouse  capt); k morgan (newport-gwent)  t shanklin (cardiff)  g henson (neath-swansea)  s williams (neath-swansea); s jones (clermont auvergne)  d peel (llanelli); g jenkins (cardiff)  m davies (gloucester)  a jones; (neath-swansea)  b cockbain (neath-swansea)  r sidoli (cardiff); r jones (neath-swansea)  m williams (cardiff)  m owen (newport-gwent).  replacements: r mcbryde (llanelli)  j yapp (cardiff)  j thomas (neath-swansea)  r sowden-taylor (cardiff)  g cooper (newport-gwent)  c sweeney newport-gwent)  r williams (cardiff).,3
entertainment,tautou film tops cesar prize nods french film a very long engagement has received 12 nominations for france s cesar film awards  despite a recent ruling it was  not french enough .  the world war i romantic drama starring audrey tautou  was recently ruled  too american  by a paris court as it was partially backed by warner bros. but the cesar organisers modified their rules to allow the film to compete. the film  directed by jean-pierre jeunet  received best actress  picture and director nominations.  last november a court judged the film was too american to compete in french film festivals. two associations of french producers challenged jeunet s right to french government subsidies  because warner bros was a backer. the ruling meant the movie - which was filmed in france and used french actors and technicians - was not eligible to compete for french prizes. but alain terzian  president of cesar organisers  the academie des arts et techniques du cinema  said the changes in eligibility rules  which allow films  of french expression   were made three months prior to the court decision. other films in the best film category include police drama 36  quai des orfevres  arnaud desplechin s kings and queen  abdellatif kechiche s l esquive and france s number one film at the 2004 box-office the chorus.  best actors are daniel auteuil for 36  mathieu amalric for kings and queen  gerard jugnot for the chorus  philippe torreton for l equipier and benoit poelvoorde for podium. tautou will compete against maggie cheung   emmanuelle devos  yolande moreau and karin viard for best actress. michael moore s fahrenheit 9/11  the motorcycle diaries  lost in translation  eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and 21 grams are all vying in the best foreign film prize. the awards ceremony will be held on 26 february. this year  will smith  star of i  robot  independence day and men in black  will be given an honorary cesar  along with french singer/actor  jacques dutronc.,1
politics,blair says uk tsunami aid to soar tony blair has predicted the british government will eventually give  hundreds of millions  of pounds in aid to countries hit by the tsunami.  the prime minister was speaking publicly for the first time since returning from his holiday in egypt. mr blair insisted he had been  intimately involved  in  all decisions at all times  despite being abroad. he was speaking before the uk joins a three-minute silence at noon across the eu for the estimated 150 000 dead.  the foreign office says 41 britons are now confirmed to have died in the tsunami which struck south asia on boxing day  with 158 others missing. asked about criticism that he did not cut short his holiday  mr blair told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  i don t think this is a situation in which the british people need me to articulate what they feel.   i think they feel - as we all do - shock  horror  and absolute solidarity with those people who have lost their lives.  the important thing was action and not words  he said  adding that of the Â£50m given by the government so far only  six or seven million  had been spent. it would become easier in the coming weeks to assess just how much money would have to be put in.  my estimate is we will need to spend from government several hundred million pounds. so we will far and away more than match the generosity of the british people   he said. asked whether he had not returned to work immediately because he was under doctors orders to rest  mr blair said there was also a story he had been away for plastic surgery.  as you can see unfortunately i am still looking the same as i always did   he joked.  the prime minister took personal charge of the uk s response on tuesday  chairing a meeting of the emergency committee of ministers that has convened daily since boxing day. he also spoke on the telephone to us president george bush  and the presidents of sri lanka and indonesia. chancellor gordon brown earlier backed a plan to freeze the foreign debts of all the affected nations.  mr brown  who was not at the downing street meeting  says he has been in  intensive talks  with other g8 finance ministers. germany proposed a freeze last week and canada has begun its own moratorium. the chancellor said the plan would initially save the most affected countries about $3bn (Â£1.58bn) in repayments. tory leader michael howard also backed the proposals but said ministers had been  playing catch-up  with public donations.  foreign secretary jack straw is to visit thailand and indonesia this week. during his trip  mr straw will represent the g8 at the international conference called in jakarta  indonesia on thursday. on friday  he will visit the thai beach resort of phuket  where british families are still searching for relatives.  international development secretary hilary benn will also visit aceh in indonesia  as well as sri lanka. the british public has now pledged Â£76m in aid with emergency supplies from the british government starting to arrive in the region on three raf flights in a joint operation with scandinavian countries. two ships - the royal fleet auxiliary ship diligence and frigate hms chatham - have arrived in the disaster area. a second royal fleet auxiliary vessel  the bayleaf  is also being sent. uk charities have also begun chartering planes to deliver aid.    - a bbc news special: asia remembered  including the three-minutes silence  will be shown on bbc one and bbc news 24 from 1130 to 1215 gmt on wednesday.,2
politics,lib dems highlight problem debt people vulnerable to problem debts should be afforded greater protection from banks aggressively promoting financial products  the lib dems say.  vincent cable says one in eight households already struggle with debt and that will worsen if there is a hike in interest rates or unemployment. the lib dems  treasury spokesman is unveiling a policy aimed at the issue. he wants to see  proper health checks  when loans are marketed so people know to take out payment protection.   were economic conditions to deteriorate at all  large numbers of people could be affected because they have borrowed to the limit   mr cable told bbc news.  banks are very aggressively promoting debt in many cases there is a bigger problem ahead.  mr cable said the government s consumer credit bill would target some of the  extreme problems  such as loan sharking  but ministers had been  a bit complacent  about the wider issue of debt levels. he said much of the payment protection currently available was  extremely expensive  and there were  lots of exclusions .  mr cable added that the office of fair trading should investigate the market. lib dem leader charles kennedy meanwhile is in the middle of a tour of the uk aimed at persuading voters his is the  real opposition . mr kennedy is visiting a mixture of rural seats  where his party is hoping to make gains from the conservatives  and urban areas traditionally associated with labour. labour say a lib dem vote could  let the tories in   while the tories say the lib dems would mean  higher taxes  soft crime laws  more power to europe . mr kennedy s tour comes as he  labour leader tony blair and conservative leader michael howard all step up campaigning ahead of the next general election  widely expected to be held on 5 may.  the liberal democrats say in the northern cities  the race is between them and labour  while in southern seats - particularly the south west - it is between them and the tories. speaking to the bbc s westminster hour on sunday  mr kennedy said the upcoming general election - widely tipped for 5 may - would be much more unpredictable than any others in  recent experience . and he brushed off labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the tories in  by the back door .  if you look at the four previous parliamentary by-elections  the liberal democrats have demonstrated that  not only can we leapfrog the conservatives where we start in a third place position  but we can go on to defeat the government.  that s going to be the story  i think  of this coming general election.,2
politics,howard rebuts asylum criticisms tory leader michael howard has gone on the offensive in response to people questioning how a son of immigrants can propose asylum quotas.  mr howard  whose parents fled the nazi threat to come to the uk  says the claim would mean no-one from an immigrant family could become premier. his comments come in a bbc documentary called  no more mr nasty . tv presenter anne robinson said as home secretary he gave the impression he would  like to kick your cat . ms robinson  a friend of the tory leader  also revealed that as a cambridge student mr howard was  much loved by women and he was a courteous and kind and rather dashing lover  - although she denied having personal experience.  i wasn t at cambridge - and it s not personal experience - but i know people who were.   documentary maker michael cockerell was given behind-the-scenes access to mr howard for his film portrait. the tory leader was asked about to respond to people who said that if there had there been a quota on immigration and asylum in the 1930s  his parents might not have been allowed into the country.  he replies:  what is the inference of that   that if you reach the view that you need to control immigration in the interests of the country you re not allowed to put a view forward if you happen to be descended from immigrants   that seems to me an absolutely extraordinary proposition  it would certainly mean no one from immigrant parents could be prime minister.   ms robinson  who presents the weakest link tells cockerell that she despaired at his hardline image when he was home secretary in john major s government.  i used to have to sit on my hands because he d get on television and give a passable impression of someone who d like to kick your cat or would put your baby in prison if he cried. i mean it was very  very draconian.  the film shows mr howard laughing at rory bremner s impression of him as dracula  which he calls  good fun   apart from the serious falsehood of a comment suggesting he wants fewer black people in the uk. the film shows the private side of the tory leader watching television at home or playing table tennis with his wife  ex-model sandra. asked if she enjoys a game of ping pong she confesses:  yeah  it would be more enjoyable if i could win occasionally too  but otherwise it s quite fun.   former downing street communications chief alastair campbell  now working on labour s election campaign  says a  touchy-feely  image does not fit mr howard. he says tony blair was not worried by his opponents  early performance in their commons clashes because mr howard lacked a  big strategy   including on issues like iraq. the tory leader brands such criticisms as  absolutely rubbish   arguing that he has been consistent on his support for the war but critical of mr blair s failure to tell the truth on intelligence. former tory chancellor ken clarke says mr howard has a bigger problem changing perceptions of the tory party than his personal image. mr clarke says the party is improving and it is  conceivable  it could win the next election. but he adds:  it has got to change itself a bit and broaden its appeal.   - michael howard: no more mr nasty is being shown on bbc2 on saturday 12 february at 2005 gmt.,2
politics,fox attacks blair s tory  lies  tony blair lied when he took the uk to war so has no qualms about lying in the election campaign  say the tories.  tory co-chairman liam fox was speaking after mr blair told labour members the tories offered a  hard right agenda . dr fox told bbc radio:  if you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war  i guess you are going to lie about anything at all.  he would not discuss reports the party repaid Â£500 000 to lord ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat.  the prime minister ratcheted up labour s pre-election campaigning at the weekend with a helicopter tour of the country and his speech at the party s spring conference. he insisted he did not know the poll date  but it is widely expected to be 5 may.  in what was seen as a highly personal speech in gateshead on sunday  mr blair said:  i have the same passion and hunger as when i first walked through the door of 10 downing street.  he described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric  then struggling to live up to the expectations  and reaching the point of raised voices and  throwing crockery . he warned his supporters against complacency  saying:  it s a fight for the future of our country  it s a fight that for britain and the people of britain we have to win.   mr blair said that whether the public chose michael howard or mr kennedy  it would result in  a tory government not a labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward . dr fox accused mr blair and other cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents  policies and then attacking the lies.  what we learned at the weekend is what labour tactics are going to be and it s going to be fear and smear   he told bbc news. the tory co-chairman attacked labour s six new pledges as  vacuous  and said mr blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver. dr fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid Â£500 000 to former tory treasurer lord ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election.  we repay loans when they are due but do not comment to individual financial matters   he said  insisting he enjoyed a  warm and constructive  relationship to lord ashcroft.  meanwhile lib dem leader charles kennedy is expected to attack mr blair s words as he begins a nationwide tour on monday. mr kennedy is accelerating lib dem election preparations this week as he visits manchester  liverpool  leicester  somerset  basingstoke  shrewsbury  dorset and torbay. he said:  this is three-party politics. in the northern cities  the contest is between labour and the liberal democrats.  in southern and rural seats - especially in the south west - the principal contenders are the liberal democrats and the conservatives  who are out of the running in scotland and wales.  the lib dems accuse mr blair of making a  touchy-feely  speech to labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust.,2

politics,brown and blair face new rift claims for the umpteenth time  tony blair and gordon brown are said to have declared all out war on each other.  this time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government s global aid and debt initiatives  particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster - an issue many hoped and believed was above such things. it dominated the prime minister s monthly news conference  which saw mr blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour. as he told journalists:  i am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers. there is a complete unity of purpose.  and he again heaped praise on mr brown saying he was doing a great job  and would continue doing it - although he would not commit to any job for mr brown after the election.  so why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with mr brown s long-arranged keynote speech on aid and debt  he was asked  by now mr blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting. he snapped back that the hacks knew very well what the operational reasons were for the timing of his press conference. well  not really  as it happens.  and he repeated what a great man gordon was and how united they were  before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers  preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world. although in the next breath he declared:  i get increasingly alarmed by what i read in the newspapers  before catching himself on and quickly adding:  in so far as i read them of course.  he probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men.  as far as the timing of the prime minister s press conference is concerned  there are two options. the first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment. if that is the case it suggests that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headlines is not enough to stop the squabbling. the second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence  which would suggest the government has lost its once-famed ability to strictly co-ordinate announcements - through the infamous downing street grid - to avert just such allegations.  either way  the effect was the same - to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue. and there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with a fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men. firstly  the prime minister insisted on wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get g8 countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunami-hit countries. it was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that gordon brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government s response to the disaster while mr blair was still on holiday in egypt.  then  as if to pour fuel on the flames  both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues foreign secretary jack straw  aid minister hilary benn and deputy prime minister john prescott - without mentioning the other. all this came amid fresh claims that mr brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had  as a result  started to set out his own platform. the fact that he used an article in the guardian newspaper to set out what he believed  should  be in the manifesto  has embarked on a mini tour of britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit africa on the same mission - often seen as the prime minister s  turf  - has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other. the prime minister denied all that as well  repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign. but the big fear with many on the labour benches now is that  unless a lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry  it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself.,2
tech,souped-up wi-fi is on the horizon super high-speed wireless data networks could soon be in use in the uk.  the government s wireless watchdog is seeking help on the best way to regulate the technology behind such networks called ultra wideband (uwb). ofcom wants to ensure that the arrival of uwb-using devices does not cause problems for those that already use the same part of the radio spectrum. uwb makes it possible to stream huge amounts of data through the air over short distances. one of the more likely uses of uwb is to make it possible to send dvd quality video images wirelessly to tv screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home. the technology has the potential to transmit hundreds of megabits of data per second. uwb could also be used to create so-called personal area networks that let a person s gadgets quickly and easily swap data amongst themselves. the technology works over a range up to 10 metres and uses billions of short radio pulses every second to carry data. at the recent consumer electronics show in las vegas products with uwb chips built-in got their first public airing.  currently  use of uwb is only allowed in the uk under a strict licencing scheme.  we re seeking opinion from industry to find out whether or not we should allow uwb on a licence-exempt basis   said a spokesman for ofcom.  companies have until 24 march to respond. in april the ec is due to start its own consultation on europe-wide adoption of uwb. the cross-europe body for radio regulators  known as the european conference of postal and telecommunications administrations (cept)  is carrying out research for this harmonisation programme. early sight of the cept work has caused controversy as some think it over-emphasises uwb s potential to interfere with existing users. by contrast a preliminary ofcom report found that it would be quite straight-forward to deploy uwb without causing problems for those that already use it. the ofcom spokesman said it was considering imposing a  mask  or set of technical restrictions on uwb-using devices.  we would want these devices to have very strict controls on power levels so they can not transmit a long way or over a wide area   he said. despite the current restrictions the technology is already being used. cambridge-based ubisense has about 40 customers around the world using the short-range radio technology  said david theriault  standards and regulatory liaison for ubisense. he said that uwb was driving novel ways to interact with computers.  it s like having a 3d mouse all the time   he said. he said that european decisions on what to do with uwb allied with ieee decisions on the exact specifications for it would help drive adoption. prior to its adoption as a way for gadgets and computers to communicate  uwb was used as a sensing technology. it is used to spot such things as cracks under the surface of runways or to help firemen detect people through walls.,4

politics,analysis: no pain  no gain  he called it his  masochism strategy  in the run-up to the iraq war and now tony blair has signed up for another dose of pain.  the idea is simple - the prime minister goes head to head with an often hostile group of  real  voters in the full spotlight of the television cameras. the theory is that talking to the great british public  even if they are the  great unwashed   is better than having the media filter what voters hear from politicians. it is also the most effective way of showing that he is aware of real people s concerns and - on occasions - of their outright fury. mr blair used the tactic before the iraq war to try to show he really was engaging with public concerns and you can expect to see it much more in the run-up to the election.  labour knows it has been damaged by accusations of spin   control freakery  and over-slick presentation - sometimes from within the ranks of its own mps. tony blair himself has said people complain he does not listen. mr blair s latest bout of flagellation came with a series of questions sessions on five television throughout wednesday.  the trouble began on the wright stuff show  with maria hutchings marching up to him  saying  tony  that s rubbish  as she tried to complain about her autistic son s school being threatened with closure. a few  don t worries  as mrs hutchings was led back to the audience averted a public slanging match - he spoke to her privately after the show. but that was only the start and later sessions produced the type of grilling not even the toughest television interviewer could produce.  writer neil coppendale  from west sussex  asked of the iraq war:  tens of thousands of innocent men  women and children died - how do you manage to sleep at night   on immigration  london teacher diane granger said:  where are you going to put everyone   and can you imagine even jeremy paxman putting the question posed by brighton nurse marion brown:  would you wipe somebody s backside for Â£5    mr blair tried to use the questioners  first names - and sometimes threw them off their stride by asking what they would do about the problems. many of the newspapers have branded the exercise a pr stunt which backfired. indeed there is a danger mr blair simply ends up looking  embattled . conservative michael howard and liberal democrat charles kennedy are to be offered chances to appear in similar slots on the channel next month. labour strategists believe more of the sessions will mean the hecklers no longer become a story and the real issues take prominence.  james humphreys  ex-head of corporate communications at number 10  says the strategy shows frustration with the media.  they feel they don t get their voice across and going direct to people is clearly their game on this occasion   he says. there are risks but the prize is tackling the trend of lower turnouts at the polls  he argues. the prime minister knows full well the potential hazards .  he must remember with gritted teeth his confrontation with sharron storer  the birmingham woman who harangued him over the state of her local hospital in the 2001 election campaign.  all you do is walk around and make yourself known  you don t do anything to help anybody   she told mr blair before stomping off  refusing his pleas to discuss the issue privately. former downing street media chief alastair campbell has described the episode as a  bit of a disaster  as it meant the launch of labour s election manifesto received little coverage. but it was seen as one of the few moments when that election campaign came alive  not least because it coincided with john prescott s even more direct contact - when he punched an egg-throwing protester.  former prime ministers too have come to grief at the hands of a persistent member of the public. the undoubted highlight of years of election phone-in shows was margaret thatcher discomfort on nationwide in 1983  when viewer diana gould put her on the spot about the sinking of the belgrano in the falklands war. john major reaped the benefits of street campaigning during the 1992 election campaign with his famous soapbox.  it may have left him splattered with eggs and engine oil at times but he felt it added  fizz  to his campaign. in his memoirs  he also argues the strategy contrasted with neil kinnock s  contrived photo opportunities  and attempts at an artful campaign.  he wanted to look like a prime minister. i  was  prime minister and i wanted a flesh and blood fight   says mr major. mr blair told prospective labour mps on thursday that taking part in phone-ins and public meetings could  enthuse and engage and give the public a sense of empowerment . but he also wants to counter complaints that he has spent too much time on international affairs and foreign trips. mr blair recalls how bill clinton once advised him:  always remember that what people see of you in the news in the evening is how they think you spend your day.  his hope must be that voters watching him on the rack will bear out for labour the old maxim:  no pain  no gain.,2
business,saudi ministry to employ women women will be employed in saudi arabia s foreign ministry for the first time this year  foreign minister prince saud al-faisal has been reported as saying.  the move comes as the conservative country inches open the door to working women. last year  crown prince abdullah  the de-facto ruler  told government departments to put plans in place for employing women. but progress has been slow  reports from the country say.  earlier this week  the local arab news said labour minister ghazi al-gosaibi had  caused uproar  when he said his ministry was having difficulty hiring women because they demanded segregated offices. the newspaper said many saudi women found his explanation  a pitiful excuse for not employing women . women now make up more than half of all graduates from saudi universities but only 5% of the workforce.  our educational reforms have created a new generation of highly-educated and professionally trained saudi women who are acquiring their rightful position in saudi society   arab news quoted prince saud as saying.  i am proud to mention here that this year we shall have women working in the ministry of foreign affairs for the first time.,0
sport,ajax refuse to rule out jol move ajax have refused to reveal whether tottenham s boss martin jol is on the dutch champions  shortlist to become the amsterdam club s new coach.  jol  who has coached in his native holland  has guided spurs to the premiership s top eight. an ajax spokesman told bbc sport:  the coach must fit our profile - a coach who understands the dutch league and offensive and distinctive football.  we need to find a solution soon  so someone is in place for next season.  ronald koeman quit as ajax boss last week after their exit from the uefa cup. jol has been linked with the vacant post at ajax  with reports saying he has fallen out with spurs  sporting director frank arnesen. but in a statement on spurs  website  jol said:  i m happy here  i m not in discussion with anyone else  i don t want to go elsewhere.  ajax have enlisted the help of dutch legend johann cruyff  currently a consultant at barcelona  to help find a new head coach. cruyff has admitted he has been impressed by the way former rfc waalwijk coach jol has turned round spurs  fortunes since taking over from jacques santini. tonny bruins slot and ruud krol are currently in charge of ajax  who are third in the dutch league.,3
business,could yukos be a blessing in disguise  other things being equal  the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for a song ought to be bad for business.  but in the looking-glass world of modern russia  the opposite might just be true  a new report* has argued. the study  from the centre for economic policy research  does not praise the rough handling of oil company yukos. but it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all russian firms  even targets of the tax police.  an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive  even accounting for increased levels of taxation   the authors say.  the paper s reasoning is complex  and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular  the propensity of management to steal from the company. the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal  since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable. in the west  meanwhile  higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues. on the other hand  increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent  forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately. the net result  the authors say  is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness.  after vladimir putin became president in 2000  he did not raise taxes  but put a lot of effort - too much  critics argue - into enforcement.  since then  the russian stock market has more than trebled in value  a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach. the report highlights the case of sibneft  a russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year. after mr putin came to power  the company s overall effective tax rate rose from 2.6% to 10.4%  and sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police. but shareholders benefited hugely: sibneft started to pay dividends - $53m in 2000 and almost $1bn in 2001 - and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds. according to the authors  although a variety of changes were sweeping through russian industry at the time  the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peers.  does this analysis make sense  in part  certainly. for all its faults  corporate russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000. companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges - something unthinkable in the wilder days of the 1990s - and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards. foreign direct investment  long negligible  is starting to flow in serious amounts - $7bn in 2003 - and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in europe. but the authors  model does not quite cover all the complexities. for a start  the model assumes that the various parties have clearly-defined motivation: companies want to maximise profit  governments want to maximise tax revenue. in fact  the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in russia - connections often greased by bribery - blur the apparently antagonistic relationship. companies can  for example  persuade officials to overlook non-payment of taxes.  and the authors  definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically western. genuine  disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in russia; the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced. the case against yukos  for example  has moved in fits and starts  with little clarity from the government about its intentions  and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed. as far as most commentators are concerned  the state is pursuing yukos out of a political vendetta  rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude. since yukos  founder  mikhail khodorkovsky  was arrested a year ago  the russian market has dropped by 10% - an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance.,0
sport,hong kong in 2011 world cup bid hong kong is hoping to join japan as co-host of the 2011 rugby world cup.  japan has applied to host the tournament on its own  with the aim of taking it outside rugby s traditional strongholds for the first time. but hong kong rugby football union (hkrfu) chairman john molloy has called for the territory to host one of the pools and a quarter-final. the japanese rugby football union (jrfu) says it has yet to receive a formal presentation from the hkrfu.  at this stage  we are only considering hosting the event by ourselves   said jrfu secretary koji tokumasu.  we cannot examine any proposal unless we get it in a definitive form.  japan faces stiff competition in the form of south africa and new zealand to host the event in seven years  time.   until now  the world cup has been held in countries from the six nations or tri-nations   said tokumasu.  we think  and the irb thinks  that it is time for rugby to go global.  japan is ready to host the tournament and we are looking forward to welcoming the world of rugby to japan.  tokumasu added that the 2002 football world cup  co-hosted by japan and south korea  had been a huge success.  as well as having the infrastructure in place  japan also has the commercial clout to host one of sport s top competitions   he said. last year  japan launched its first professional rugby league and it has the fourth largest number of registered players (125 508) in the world after england  south africa and france.,3
politics,schools to take part in mock poll record numbers of schools across the uk are to take part in a mock general election backed by the government.  some 600 schools have already signed up for the y vote mock elections 2005 run by the hansard society and aimed at boosting interest in politics. pupils in the schools taking part will learn the skills of speech writers  canvassers and political candidates. schools minister stephen twigg said engaging young people s interest was  essential  to the future of democracy.  he added: said  young people who are engaged and motivated by the political process are essential to the future health of our democracy.  the mock elections initiative provides an opportunity for pupils to develop their own understanding of how the democratic process works and why it matters.  by experiencing the election process first hand - from running a campaign to the declaration of the final result - we hope that young people will develop the enthusiasm to take part in the future.  the hansard society  the electoral commission and the department for education and skills are running the programme. pupils will stand as party candidates  speech writers and canvassers. michael raftery  project manager at the hansard society  said:  the y vote mock elections for schools mirror the excitement and buzz of a real election  raising awareness of citizenship  and the benefits of active democracy.  the mock votes will take place around 5 may  widely expected to be the date of the general election. information packs  including ballot papers and manifesto guides  with elections happening in early may were sent out to the 3 000 schools invited to take part.,2
tech,web radio takes spanish rap global spin the radio dial in the us and you are likely to find plenty of spanish-language music. but what you will not find is much spanish-language hip-hop.  hip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the spanish-speaking world  but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad. but now  a us company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere. los caballeros de plan g are one of mexico s hottest hip-hop acts. they have a devoted fan base in their native monterrey. but most mexican hip-hop fans  not to mention fans in most of the spanish-speaking world  rarely get a chance to hear the group s tracks on the radio.   you can t really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in spanish... it s just not accessible   says manuel millan  a native of san diego  california.  it s really hard for the spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. you usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world.  millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like los caballeros de plan g accessible to fans globally.  mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music  and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. so  millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. the name says it all: it is web-based radio  devoted to the hottest spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. the site  which is in both in english and spanish  is meant to be easy to navigate. all the user has to do is download a media player. there are no djs. it is just music streamed over the net for free. suddenly  with the help of the website  los caballeros de plan g are producing  export quality  rap.  the web might be just the right medium for spanish language hip-hop right now. the genre is in what millan calls its  infant stage . but the production values are improving  and artists such as argentina s mustafa yoda are pushing to make it better and better. mustafa yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com.  he s considered the eminem of argentina  and the latin american hip-hop scene   millan says.  he really hasn t had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world  but he s definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the spanish-speaking world.  currently  the chilean group makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com s top 10  as is cuban artist papo record.  every country s got it s own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs   millan says. latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. the site has listeners from across the spanish speaking world. right now  mexico leads the way  accounting for about 50% of listeners. but web surfers in spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station s traffic comes from there. that is not surprising as many consider spain to be the leader in spanish-language rap and hip-hop. millan says that spain is actually just behind the united states and france in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. that might be changing  though  as more and more latin american artists are finding audiences.  but one spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com s top 10. his name is tote king and manuel millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in spain. on his track uno contra veinte emcees  or one against 20 emcees  tote king shows he is well aware of that fact.  it s basically him bragging that he s one of the best emcees in spain right now   millan says.  and it s pretty much true. he has the tightest productions  and his rap flow is impeccable  it s amazing.  latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of spanish language hip-hop and rap.  clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world  a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production.,4
sport,tevez - an argentine in brazil some 65 years ago bernardo gandulla left boca juniors in his native argentina and headed for brazil.  he arrived at the vasco da gama club with considerable prestige - which he failed to live up to. he left an impression  but not for reasons he would have wanted. the only thing of note he did was to throw the ball back when it went out of play. even today   gandula  is the term used in brazil for ballboy. brazilians delighted in the failure of gandulla then  and many will delight now if history is repeated. another boca juniors player is coming to brazil.  the new maradona  - carlos tevez - is joining corinthians for nearly $20m in a strong candidate for the strangest move of the year. corinthians - or the london-based company who have just entered into partnership with them - appear to have paid well above the odds for tevez. it is particularly strange as - until last week - tevez was not even an especially big name in brazil  where the argentine championship is not shown.  presumably there is some financial logic behind the move. what is harder to work out is why tevez should be interested in heading north  rather than across the atlantic. argentina s brightest new star hit top form in august as he spearheaded the charge towards the olympic gold medal. but the subsequent months have not been easy for tevez. boca re-signed martin palermo  forcing tevez to vacate his favoured centre forward role. and off the pitch he gave the press plenty to report - atletico madrid gave up on him after declaring his private life to be  disorganized.  hounded by the press  tevez grew tired of his life in buenos aires. so now he says that he is heading for corinthians in search of  tranquillity.  anyone acquainted with the city of s&#227;o paulo will relish the nonsense of this declaration. brazil s biggest city is a sprawling  ugly  restless metropolis. once it shared with buenos aires the same melancholy air of a city of italian immigrants.  but that world now lies buried under skyscrapers. the most turbulent place in this frenetic city is sport club corinthians. it is the most passionately supported club in brazil. pel&#233; scored reams of goals against them  reasoning that unless he did something special the corinthians fans were capable of winning the game on their own. that passion can also be turned against the team - especially nowadays  when the level of urban violence gives a hysterical edge to life in brazil s big cities. corinthians fans have invaded the dressing room or ambushed the team coach to attack the players. tevez  then  can kiss tranquillity goodbye. he can also say farewell to the copa libertadores  south america s champions league. corinthians have not qualified. indeed  he will have a long wait for a worthwhile match. next year s brazilian championship only gets underway at the end of april. until then he will have to make do with the foolish s&#227;o paulo state championship  an appalling waste of his talent. there will be matches in small towns on poor pitches with plenty of defenders keen to kick him all the way back to argentina. like so many of the top south american players  tevez has the gift of being able to surprise - to feint right and go left  to pass when he was expected to dribble  to shoot and catch the goalkeeper unawares. but his choice of destination is the biggest surprise of all.,3
politics,labour s core support takes stock tony blair has told labour supporters he s  back  and still hungry for the job of prime minister - but does that sum up the mood at the party s spring conference in gateshead    the electorate are keener on the government than some labour party members   is the dry assessment of graham lane  leader of the labour group on newham council. the problem  according to mr lane  is not continuing divisions over iraq  foundation hospitals or tuition fees  or even voter apathy  but mr blair himself.  i have a new slogan. vote blair  get brown. that s what i am telling people on the doorstep. don t worry  he will be gone soon.  his friend  saxon spence  leader of devon county labour group  lays the blame for any lack of campaigning zeal on one issue above all others.  you cannot underestimate the impact of the war in iraq. we lost people from our local party who had some key roles.   but the two friends were fired up by gordon brown s speech on saturday  with its appeal to core labour values on social justice  health and education.   there was real passion. i think we have all felt a little jaded  but it reminded us why we joined the party in the first place   said mrs spence.  if he hadn t have walked off the stage  they would still be clapping   added mr lane. but for every brownite at the spring conference there was an equally ardent fan of mr blair. stephen douglas  26  from wales  said after the pm s speech on sunday:  i think it was a bit of a turning point  given the roasting he has had on some issues. the guy still has it.   tony martin  of burnley  said:  he is the first leader who has won us two terms. this bloke has delivered for us.  malcolm shipley  of shipley  said it was  as if he is coming round to the right approach again . katrina bull  a prospective parliamentary candidate said mr blair had shown he could rouse the party s grassroots:  i think if every voter was able to spend time in a room with tony  the way we have today  we will have no problem with turnout.  she had just emerged from a q&a session  in which mr blair - tieless and supremely at ease - answered questions posed via the party s website.  a party of councillors from nottingham agreed that there was nothing wrong with mr blair s leadership - and they were adamant that the campaigning strength of the party in their city was as strong as ever. iraq  they insisted  would not be a factor for most voters.  the biggest problem we have got at the moment is that we keep getting all these polls saying we are going to run away with the election.  it might sound great  but it does create this sense of complacency among our own voters and i think that is the greater problem than iraq   said nottingham city councillor brian parbutt. and even mr blair s most vocal critics seemed to agree on one thing - he is a master of the sort of glossy  high-profile campaigning that has become labour s hallmark  epitomised by friday s whistle-stop tour of marginal seats. a group of shop stewards from the swan hunter shipyard  who said they were facing redundancy  could barely suppress their anger at mr blair s failure to  as they saw it  shake off his tory leanings and stand up for manufacturing in the north east.  they were also scathing about the alleged benefits of showpiece projects such as conference venue sage centre  heralded by john prescott and others this weekend as a symbol of labour s success in urban regeneration.   it is no good having the sage or baltic if you haven t got the money for the entrance fee   said terry telford. but when asked about mr blair s bravura performance on friday  the men agreed he was  brilliant . and they would all be out on the doorstep pushing the labour message come election time.  if you are not fired up about the election  then what s the point  there is no complacency as far as i can see in the labour party. we are fired up. we are up for this election   said richie porterhouse. mr telford agreed  but added it was becoming increasingly difficult to think of an answer when people asked  what has labour done for the north east    i have had doors slammed in my face   he said.  every activist i spoke to said they were proud of what they believed labour had achieved in their local communities - the new hospitals and schools  the better life chances for young people. the problem they faced  they said  was converting this local feelgood factor into votes. but they could at least rely on one  secret weapon   as one activist put it - tory leader michael howard.,2
sport,mcilroy wins 800m indoor title james mcilroy motored to the aaa s indoor 800m title in sheffied on sunday in a time of one minute  47.97 seconds.  the larne athlete dominated the race from start to finish although he had to hold off a late challenge from welshman jimmy watkins in the final 100 metres.  i had to go out and go through all the gears before the europeans and i won t run again until then   said mcilroy.   i though if i got lucky i d get close to the british record but i blew up in the end.   mcilroy has been in superb form at the start of the season and will now start his build-up for the european indoors at madrid on 4-6 march. meanwhile  paul brizzel and anna boyle reached the semi-finals of the 60m hurdles with boyle setting a season s best of 7.48. in the women s 60m final  ailis mcsweeney broke michelle carroll s long-standing irish record by clocking 7.37 which left her in third place. david gillick showed that he is a genuine medal contender in the european indoor championships by claiming an impressive 400m victory. gillick was more than half-a-second clear when taking gold in 46.45 - .02 outside his personal best set in saturday s semi-finals.  the irishman is now the fastest european this season. derval o rourke broke her own irish 60m hurdles record by clocking 8.06 which left her third behind new british record holder sarah claxton (7.96). james nolan (3:46.04) took second in the men s 1500m behind neil speaight (3:45.86) but the offaly man was outside the european indoor standard. colin costello was seventh in the 1500m final in 3:48.82). deirdre ryan was second in the women s high jump with a clearance of 1.87m while aoife byrne took silver in the 800m in a personal best of 2:06.73. lisburn s kelly mcneice reid (4:31.34) was seventh in the women s 1500m while gary murray (8:11.22) was 11th in the men s 3000m. meanwhile  stephen cairns and jill shannon claimed the individual titles at saturday s northern ireland cross country championship in coleraine. cairns came in ahead of paul rowan and allan bogle in the men s race. willowfield claimed their first men s team title in 72 years while shannon helped lagan valley win the women s team honours.,3
business,bmw reveals new models pipeline bmw is preparing to enter the market for car-style people carriers  the firm s chief has told bbc news.  speaking at a bmw event ahead of the geneva motor show  helmut panke predicted demand for such crossover vehicles would soar in europe. in contrast  he said  the popularity of van-style seven-seat vehicles and traditional saloon cars would fade.  customers are moving out of the mini-van (and) traditional concepts are not as attractive anymore   he said.  we have decided that bmw will enter the [crossover] segment   he said in the clearest indication yet about the car maker s intentions.  mr panke praised the honda accura as the  best execution  yet of a crossover vehicle.  we have decided that the bmw brand will enter the segment   he said.  a decision on just how bmw will manage its entry into the new market is due in the first half of 2005. typically it takes about three years from when a decision is taken before a new model hits the streets  mr panke said  implying that a bmw crossover could be on the market by 2008. the coming switch is driven in part by the need for successful carmakers to stay aware of trans-atlantic differences in the car market  mr panke insisted. while in the us drivers tend to prefer sports utility vehicles (suvs)  such as the bmw x5 and its sibling x3  in europe demand for crossover vehicles is likely to be considerable  mr panke said.  there s a growing market here   he said.  we are going to go that way.,0
tech,the year search became personal the odds are that when you fire up your browser  you go straight to your favourite search engine  rather than type in a web address.  some may see this as the height of laziness  but in an era of information overload  search has become a vital tool in navigating the net. it is symptomatic of how the way we use the internet is changing. and as google has shown  there is money in offering a service that people cannot live without. there is no shortage of companies vying for the loyalty of web searchers  offering a wealth of different services and tools to help you find what you want. over the past 12 months  giants of the technology world such as microsoft and yahoo have sought to grab a slice of the search action.  user experience has contributed to people searching more   said yonca brunini of yahoo. as people become more familiar with the internet  they tend to spend more time online and ask more queries  she said.  the other second thing is broadband   ms brunini told the bbc news website.  this will do to internet what colour has done to tv.   but search is hardly a new phenomenon. it has been around since the early days of the net.  veteran surfers will remember old-timers like hotbot and altavista.  search was always important   said urs holzle  google vice-president of operations.  we trumpeted that in 1999. it is even truer now as there are more users and more information.   people didn t realise that search was the future. the financials have something to do with it.  google has shown web commerce can work through its targeted small adverts  which appear at the top and down the right-hand side of a page and are related to the original search. these small ads helped google reach revenues of $805.9m for the three months to september. others have woken up to the fact that you can make money out of web queries.  once you see there is a market  microsoft is bound to step to it. if microsoft sees search as important  then nobody queries it   said mr holzle.  microsoft is just one of the net giants muscling in on search. yahoo  ask jeeves  amazon and a handful of smaller outfits are all seeking to capture eyeballs.  web users face a plethora of choices as each company tries to outflank google by rolling out new search products such as desktop search. it reflects how the battlefield has shifted from the net to your pc. search is not just about finding your way around the web. it is now about unlocking information hidden in the gigabytes of documents  images and music on hard drives. for all these advances  search is still a clumsy tool  often failing to come up with exactly what you had in mind. in order to do a better job  search engines are trying to get to know you better  doing a better job of remembering  cataloguing and managing all the information you come across.  personalisation is going to be a big area for the future   said yahoo s yonca brunini.  whoever cracks that and gives you the information you want is going to be the winner. we have to understand you to give you better results that are tailored to you.  this is perhaps the holy grail of search  understanding what it is you are looking for and providing it quickly. the problem is that no one yet knows how to get there.,4
business,fiat mulls ferrari market listing ferrari could be listed on the stock market as part of an overhaul of fiat s carmaking operations  the financial times has reported.  it said fiat was set to restructure its business after reaching a $2bn (1.53bn euros; Â£1.05bn) settlement with gm about fiat s ownership. steps being considered include listing ferrari and bringing maserati and alfa romeo closer together  it said. despite strong sales of alfa romeo  fiat s car business is making a loss.  under the proposals - which the paper said could be announced within days - the iconic sportscar maker could be listed separately on the market. fiat owns a 56% stake in ferrari -best known for its dominant formula one motor racing team - having first bought into the business in 1969. it considered floating ferrari in 2002 but opted to sell a minority stake to italian bank mediobanca for 775m euros ($1bn). that sale valued ferrari - which owns the maserati brand - at 2.3bn euros. the price tag would change if maserati was stripped out. the financial times said fiat may transfer maserati within its wholly- owned alfa romeo division in an effort to exploit commercial synergies. such a move would help alfa romeo and maserati to share marketing  distribution and research & development costs. maserati and ferrari sell about 10 000 cars between them and both companies broke even in 2003.  fiat  italy s largest private sector employer  did not comment on the reported changes. fiat recently negotiated an end to its alliance with general motors. the us firm agreed to pay $2bn to exit an agreement under which it could have been liable to buy fiat outright. analysts said the reported restructuring was evidence of the greater flexibility which fiat now had to develop the business.,0
politics,iraqis win death test case probe the family of an iraqi civilian allegedly killed by uk troops have won a challenge against the government s refusal to order a full inquiry.  the high court ruled on tuesday that baha mousa s death in british custody in iraq fell within the european convention on human rights. and the judges paved the way for an independent inquiry by saying previous investigations were inadequate. but judicial reviews into five other deaths in southern iraq were ruled out. their families will be appealing against the judgement.  the families  solicitor phil shiner described it as  a historic day for human rights and the rule of law in the uk . father-of-two mr mousa  28  a hotel receptionist  was arrested with eight men seized at a hotel in basra in september 2003. he was allegedly beaten to death while in the custody of the queen s lancashire regiment. the iraqi families  lawyer argued that failing to adequately investigate the death breached the european convention on human rights.  ministry of defence lawyers argued the uk-controlled area of southern iraq was outside european jurisdiction. but lord justice rix and mr justice forbes ruled that uk jurisdiction could extend to a uk-run prison  but did not apply  to the total territory of another state . they said as mr mousa was in custody when he died  his case came within the uk s jurisdiction. the other five iraqis did not die in custody  so their cases had to fail  they said.  and it was difficult to say that the investigation which had already occurred  has been timely  open or effective   the judges said. after the ruling carla ferstman  legal director of the human rights organisation redress  said:  it is not enough for the military to investigate behind closed doors.  there must be an effective public investigation by an independent official body. only such an investigation could reveal what really happened and who might be responsible.  other allegations involving british soldiers included the shooting of an iraqi police commissioner and the shooting of four iraqi civilians in may 2003. both sides were granted permission to appeal.  prime minister tony blair s official spokesman said:  obviously we will need to study this detailed judgment. i would point out  however  that a separate criminal case is currently being considered by the army prosecuting authority.  i can t say anything further for obvious reasons. the mod are considering whether to appeal.  but former british commander colonel bob stewart said :  anyone at the top [of the military] will be saddened by the verdict that has taken place but will say:  if there s a case to answer  let s have it out. because we don t want people thinking that british soldiers beat up civilians and get away with it    he said.  the ministry of defence does everything in its power to try to prove we act ethically and properly under the rules of war.,2
sport,lewis-francis eyeing world gold mark lewis-francis says his olympic success has made him determined to bag world championship 100m gold in 2005.  the 22-year-old pipped maurice greene on the last leg of the 4x100m relay in athens to take top honours for team gb. but individually  the birchfield harrier has yet to build on his world junior championship win four years ago.  the gold medal in athens has made me realise that i can get to the top level and i want to get there again. it can happen  i don t see why not   he said. lewis-francis has still to decided what events will feature in his build-up to the worlds - with one exception. he has confirmed his participation in the norwich union grand prix in birmingham on 18 february  where he will take on another member of britain s victorious men s relay team - jason gardener - over 60m. he added:  it s a bit too early to make any predictions for helsinki  but i have my eyes open and i know i can be the best in the world.,3
politics,labour accused of  eu propaganda  a  taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise  on the eu is being used to lull the british public into a false sense of security  say the tories.  shadow foreign secretary michael ancram told mps a new white paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the eu constitution. his claims were denied by foreign secretary jack straw  who accused the tories of  running scared  of debate. eu cooperation would help get better uk immigration controls  he argued.  mr straw used thursday s commons debate to launch the new white paper on the prospects for the eu in 2005. security  stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the uk took over the chairmanship of the eu in july  said mr straw. africa and climate change would also feature highly. he said the uk was trying to ensure future eu budgets were limited to 1% of europe s economic output and were spent  where it adds most value . mr straw promised to continue to ensure the uk s budget rebate  secured in 1984 by margaret thatcher  was  fully justified .  we  like all other countries  have a veto on any changes proposed in this area   he said.  mr ancram condemned the document  which the foreign office says has cost about Â£2 500 to design  print and deliver.  isn t the reason that the government is now involved in a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise to try to sell the new eu to the country in advance of the forthcoming referendum and general election    he asked. the tory spokesman also criticised the government for claiming the eu constitution would make europe easier to understand.  the government  last week  had to publish a commentary of 500 pages to try and explain this  easy and simple  constitution to the british people   he said.  who are they trying to kid   the proposed question for the constitution referendum is:  should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union   the electoral commission on thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand. the government has suggested the referendum on the constitution could take place in spring 2006  with the tories set to campaign for a  no  vote.  mr ancram said ministers were prolonging uncertainty by putting the vote off until the latest date possible. the foreign secretary hit back by saying tory attitudes to europe had helped keep the party out of power for more than a decade. mr straw argued cooperation with european partners could bring a  level playing field  on immigration and asylum controls.  you are setting your face against all of these things   he added. for the liberal democrats  sir menzies campbell said the uk should not ignore the need to reform the eu common agricultural policy. change was particularly important for developing countries wanting access to markets  he argued. sir menzies was among those worried about plans  backed by the uk  to lift the arms embargo imposed on china after the tiananmen square massacre. mr straw said no decisions had been taken - chinese human rights had improved but not by enough.,2
business,air passengers win new eu rights air passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking  cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation.  new eu rules set compensation at between 250 euros (Â£173) and 600 euros  depending on the length of the flight. the new rules will apply to all scheduled and charter flights  including budget airlines. airlines have attacked the legislation saying they could be forced to push prices higher to cover the extra cost. the european commission is facing two legal challenges - one from the european low-fare airlines association (elaa) and the other from the international air transport association (iata)  which has attacked the package as a  bad piece of legislation . previously  passengers could claim between 150 euros and 300 euros if they had been stopped from boarding.  however  only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations.  the eu decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights. overbooking can often lead to  bumping  - when a passenger is moved to a later flight. when this happens against a passenger s will  airlines will now have to offer compensation. in addition  if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline  all passengers must be paid compensation.  however  airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to  extraordinary circumstances . airlines fear that  extraordinary circumstances  may not include bad weather  security alerts or strikes - events which are outside of their control. all eu-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the eu will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on thursday. low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels  arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket.  it s a preposterous piece of legislation  we among all airlines are fighting this   ryanair deputy chief executive michael cawley told radio 4 s today programme.  the european regions airline association (eraa) claims that neither airlines nor consumers were consulted over the changes. andy clarke  eraa director of air transport  said that the ec advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather.  ec spokeswoman marja quillinan-meiland conceded there were  grey areas  but said  these are not as big as the airlines are making out . in cases of dispute  national enforcement bodies would decide whether the passenger had a case  she said. new technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather  she added. the eraa s mr clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules  the extra costs would be passed onto passengers.  we reckon it s going to cost european air passengers - not the airlines  the airlines have no money  it has to be paid by passengers - 1.5bn euros  that s over Â£1bn a year loaded onto european passengers   mr clarke said.  that s basically a transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted.   on wednesday  jacques barrot  vice president of the european commission and also commissioner for transport  said that the changes were necessary.  the boom in air travel needs to be accompanied by proper protection of passengers  right.   this is a concrete example of how the union benefits people s daily lives   he added. the ec has launched an information campaign in airports and travel agencies to inform airline passengers of their new rights.,0
entertainment,brookside actress keaveney dies actress anna keaveney  who appeared in brookside  my family and a touch of frost  has died of lung cancer aged 55.  keaveney  who played brookside s marie jackson when the channel 4 soap began in 1982  died on saturday. born in runcorn  cheshire  she also starred in numerous films including 1989 s shirley valentine. she played nellie in mike leigh s latest film vera drake  which won the golden lion prize for best film at this year s venice film festival.  and most recently she appeared alongside richard wilson in itv s king of fridges and with martin clunes in doc martin. other tv appearances included the part of matron in itv drama footballers  wives and a cameo role as tom farrell s mother sheila in bbc comedy gimme gimme gimme. keaveney s career also included stage performances in neaptide for the national theatre  private lives and the rise and fall of little voice. the actress died in hospital. her agent barry brown said:  anna was due to have had another operation on friday but unfortunately she was too weak.,1
tech,the future in your pocket if you are a geek or gadget fan  the next 12 months look like they are going to be a lot of fun.  the relentless pace of development in the hi-tech world and rampant competition in many of its sectors  particularly among mobile phone firms  all suggests that 2005 is going to be a very good year. to begin with  2005 will be the year that third-generation (3g) mobile phones become inescapable. the 3 network launched in 2003  vodafone launched its consumer service in november  orange followed in early december and t-mobile and o2 are due to launch in 2005. the main result of these launches will likely be a slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up.  already the extra capacity in 3g networks lets 3 offer good deals on voice calls at rates that will probably have to be matched by the other operators. but the shift in technology and low cost of voice calls means that operators lose a significant chunk of their revenue.  show me an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them  and i ll write their obituary  said niel ransom  chief technology officer at alcatel.  instead operators are likely to push all other things that 3g phones can do such as video messaging and other multimedia capabilities. already camera phones look set to challenge digital cameras and are likely to win more fans as multi-megapixel devices go on sale. but 3g will not have everything its own way. it will face competition from emerging technologies such as wimax. this wireless technology can boost data transmission speeds up to 75 megabits per second and works over distances of up to 30 miles. kent is likely to be the site of the uk s first wimax network which is due to go live in 2005 and it could be the way that rural areas get high-speed net access. analyst firm telecom view predicts that wimax will steal a lot of market share from 3g and will be a clear winner. bob larribeau  principal analyst at telecom view  said the better return on investment offered by technologies such as wimax could dent the possible returns of 3g networks. and the growing ubiquity of wi-fi must not be forgotten either. the technology is popping up in more places than ever and its wider use is only held back by the price differences across countries and suppliers.  moves to unite mobile and fixed phones look set to get more emphasis in 2005 too.  for a start  bt looks set to roll out its bluephone project during the next 12 months. the service revolves around a hybrid device that uses the mobile networks when you are out and about but switches back to the fixed line when you are at home. fixed line phones will also start to get much more serious competition from a technology that has the formidable name of voice over ip (voip). voip routes calls via the net instead of the fixed line phone network. anyone with a broadband connection  which is now more than 50% of the uk s net using population  can use voip and could slash their monthly phone bills if they used it. telecommunications regulator ofcom has declared 056 to be the area code for voip calls and 2005 is likely to see a lot more consumer-focused voip call services starting up. home broadband services will also start to increase in speed as dwindling numbers of new users signing force the pace of competition. if 2004 has been the year of the portable music player  they 2005 looks like it will be the year of the portable media player. motorola has just announced a deal with apple to produce a phone that works with the itunes service and other hybrid gadgets that sport a big memory and lots of other functions will become commonplace. the pace of advancement in storage media will continue mean that the cost per megabyte of memory will plummet. some of those devices will sport huge hard drives letting you store more data than you ever wanted or knew you had. convergence could mean that single-function devices start to dwindle in number. instead every gadget will be able to do almost anything and communicate almost any way you want. the only downside is that consumers will face a series of tough choices as they are confronted by a bewildering array of gadgets each with an enormous numbers of features and vast data holding capacities. but that is the kind of problem most gadget fans can live with.,4
business,worldcom director ends evidence the former chief financial officer at us telecoms firm worldcom has finished giving evidence at the trial of his ex-boss bernie ebbers.  scott sullivan admitted to jurors he was willing to commit fraud to meet wall street earnings projections. mr ebbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to worldcom s collapse in 2002. he pleads not guilty. mr sullivan has spent two days being cross-examined by lawyers for former worldcom chief executive mr ebbers.  attorney reid weingarten has attempted to portray mr sullivan as a liar and on thursday quizzed him about his decision to commit fraud to meet analysts  profit estimates.  at that point in time   mr sullivan said  referring to the first false entries in late 2000   i knew it was wrong and i knew it was against the law  but i thought we would get through it in the short term.  mr sullivan  42  has already pleaded guilty to fraud and will be sentenced following mr ebbers  trial  where he is appearing as a prosecution witness. mr ebbers  63  has always insisted that he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in worldcom s finances. the former finance officer said mr ebbers knew about the improper accounting entries that were made between 2000 and 2002 to conceal soaring expenses and inflate revenue.  mr ebbers could face a sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. worldcom s problems appear to have begun with the collapse of the dotcom boom which cut its business from internet companies. prosecutors allege that the company s top executives responded by orchestrating massive fraud over a two-year period. worldcom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004  and is now known as mci. on monday  mci agreed to a buyout by verizon communications in a deal valued at $6.75bn.,0
tech,ds aims to touch gamers the mobile gaming industry is set to explode in 2005 with a number of high-profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback. market leader nintendo  however  is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played.  the first striking thing about the ds is how retro it looks. far from looking like a mould-breaking handheld  it looks more like nintendo dug out a mould from a 1980s handheld prototype. the lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens  and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree. both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive. nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen.  the japanese gaming giant hopes the ds will maintain the firm s pre-eminence in an increasingly-competitive mobile gaming market.  nintendo first launched its gameboy console in 1989 and has dominated the market ever since. but its lead can no longer be taken for granted. sony will enter the market later this year with its playstation portable  while start-up companies gizmondo and tapwave zodiac are also offering hybrid devices.  we believe the ds will appeal to all ages  both genders and gamers of any skill   said david yarnton  nintendo europe s general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld. with its two screens  wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the gameboy advance  the ds certainly has a number of unique selling points. it went on sale in the us in mid-november priced $150 and nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations  without giving detailed figures. japan and europe will have to wait until the first quarter of 2005 to get the device. with more than two million pre-orders for the device in japan  nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot. but will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed  the game ships with a demo of metroid hunters - a 3d action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machine s wireless capabilities. it certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people.  the game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim. the top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a top-down map and the ability to switch weapons. it is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating. super mario 64 ds is a faithful re-creation of the nintendo 64 classic with a host of new mini-games and new levels. the game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine. one thing is for certain. hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices  ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers. if they manage to create titles which use the nintendo ds s key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up. the fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks.,4
business,mild winter drives us oil down 6% us oil prices have fallen by 6%  driven down by forecasts of a mild winter in the densely populated northeast.  light crude oil futures fell $2.86 to $41.32 a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange (nymex)  and have now lost $4 in five days. nonetheless  us crude is still 30% more expensive than at the beginning of 2004  boosted by growing demand and bottlenecks at refineries. traders ignored the possible effects of asia s tidal waves on global supplies.  instead  the focus is now on us consumption  which is heavily influenced in the short term by the weather.  with the revised milder temperatures... i m more inclined to think we ll push lower and test the $40-40.25 range   said john brady of abn amro.  the market definitely feels to be on the defensive.  statistics released last week showed that stockpiles of oil products in the us had risen  an indication that severe supply disruptions may not arise this winter  barring any serious incident. oil prices have broken records in 2004  topping $50 a barrel at one point  driven up by a welter of worries about unrest in iraq and saudi arabia  rising demand and supply bottlenecks. london s international petroleum exchange remained closed for the christmas holiday.,0
entertainment,douglas set for indian adventure actor michael douglas is to co-produce and star in an adventure film about a diamond robbery set in india.  the new picture is expected to be similar to douglas s action films of the 1980s  romancing the stone and the jewel of the nile. another hollywood star is being lined up to co-star  while the rest of the cast will be indian. aishwarya rai  star of bride and prejudice  is the  preferred choice  of the indian studio involved in the film.  on a visit to india  the 60-year-old actor said he hoped to start shooting racing the monsoon next year. douglas added that it had been inspired by a wall street journal article about india s  angadias   who courier money and diamonds around india.  the actor s own production company  further films  is working in partnership with two indian film-making concerns to bring the picture to the screen. shailendra singh  the founder of india s percept films  said there would be  a lot of india  in the movie - and that an indian train would play a big role.  the train will be a crucial part of the film. the chase and most of the stunts will be on the train   said mr singh. swashbuckling adventure film romancing the stone saw douglas s female co-star kathleen turner win a golden globe award for her performance in 1985.,1

tech,tech helps disabled speed demons an organisation has been launched to encourage disabled people to get involved in all aspects of motorsport  which is now increasingly possible thanks to technological innovations.  the motorsport endeavour club left the starting grid yesterday at the autosport international 2005 show at birmingham s nec  with several technologies to adapt vehicles on display.  motorcycle racer  roy tansley  from derby developed his electronic sequential gear changer following an accident which resulted in part of his left leg being amputated.  i needed to find a way of changing gear and generally you do that with your left leg   mr tansley told the bbc news website.  in simple terms  i needed to invent a left foot - initially it was quite a heath robinson device.  mr tansley had to argue his case to be allowed to continue competing with motorcycle racing s governing body  the autocycle union.  at that time they wouldn t let any amputee race at all  but eventually they told me i could have a licence as long as i raced sidecars.  mr tansley s invention  the pro-shift  is designed to work with hewland gearboxes which are widely used in motorcycle racing. in addition to helping disabled riders to compete  mr tansley reckons that the pro-shift saves at least 20 seconds per lap when he competes in the isle of man tt. as a result  there has been considerable interest in the product from other riders keen to improve their performance.  i m not prejudiced  i ll sell to able-bodied people if i have to!  he joked.  another exhibit on the motorsport endeavour stand is a subaru impreza rally car  adapted to accommodate a variety of disabilities. the vehicle belongs to pararallying  the world s only rally school for disabled drivers which is based in lincolnshire.   we use the latest technology supplied by an italian company   said rally driver dave hawkins who runs the company.  the cars have electronic throttles  electronic brakes  electronic clutches - we ve yet to turn anybody away.  mr hawkins - a paraplegic himself - says his customers have included right or left arm amputees  quadriplegics  people who have had strokes and a woman who had had all four limbs amputated. pararallying uses a vauxhall astra gsi with an automatic gearbox and manual subaru imprezas. the car on display is fitted with a  duck clutch  - a switch on the gear stick used instead of the clutch pedal. it also has a second ring behind the steering wheel to operate the throttle and a hand operated brake bar.  when joy rainey started competing in motorsport in 1974 she was continuing the family tradition - her father  murray  is a former australian formula 3 champion.  and it was rainey senior who modified a sports racer to accommodate his daughter s small stature so that she could take part in hill climbs. she uses an ordinary road car by putting extensions on the pedals  a cushion behind her back and raising the seat.  but in a competition car you have to have everything right or you ll lose the balance of the car   she said.  i bring everything back to me - steering wheel  steering column  gear lever and pedals.  when she recently took part in the london to sydney marathon she shared the driving with her partner  trevor  who now does the engineering work. he designed a system for their morris minor so that the adaptations could be totally removed in under a minute. the motorsport endeavour club is hoping that putting such technologies on display will result in more disabled people becoming involved in all areas of the sport and at every level.,4
tech,rich pickings for hi-tech thieves viruses  trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change.  the shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash  steal valuable data or take over home pcs. viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer. instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code.  the growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs. before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines. but many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package.   you cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to   said pete simpson  head of the threat laboratory at security firm clearswift. now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms  or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e-mail message attachments.  it s about outright criminality now   said mr simpson  explaining why this change has come about. he said many of the criminal programs came from eastern europe where cash-rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order. former virus writer marek strihavka  aka benny from the 29a virus writing group  recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers  phishing gangs  and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology. no longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors. not least  said paul king  principal security consultant at cisco  because the defences against such attacks are so common.  in many ways the least likely way to do it is e-mail because most of us have got anti-virus and firewalls now   he said. few of the malicious programs written by hi-tech thieves are cleverly written  many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data.  if you think of criminals they do not do clever   said mr king   they just do what works.   as the tactics used by malicious programs change  said mr king  so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves. now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network.  many will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded. as well as using different tactics  criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent.  the main motivation now is money   said gary stowell  spokesman for st bernard software. mr stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high. with almost any phishing or spyware attack  criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover. so-called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends  to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites. in some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on pcs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine.,4
business,india widens access to telecoms india has raised the limit for foreign direct investment in telecoms companies from 49% to 74%.  communications minister dayanidhi maran said that there is a need to fund the fast-growing mobile market. the government hopes to increase the number of mobile users from 95 million to between 200 and 250 million by 2007.  we need at least $20bn (Â£10.6bn) in investment and part of this has to come as foreign direct investment   said mr maran. the decision to raise the limit for foreign investors faced considerable opposition from the communist parties  which give crucial support to the coalition headed by prime minister manmohan singh. potential foreign investors will however need government approval before they increase their stake beyond 49%  mr maran said. key positions  such as those of chief executive  chief technology officer and chief financial officer are to be held by indians  he added.  analysts and investors have welcomed the government decision.  it is a positive development for carriers and the investment community  looking to take a longer-term view of the huge growth in the indian telecoms market   said gartner s principal analyst kobita desai.  the fdi relaxation coupled with rapid local market growth could really ignite interest in the indian telecommunication industry   added ernst and young s sanjay mehta. investment bank morgan stanley has forecast that india s mobile market is likely to grow by about 40% a year until 2007. the indian mobile market is currently dominated by four companies  bharti televentures which has allied itself with singapore telecom  essar which is linked with hong kong-based hutchison whampoa  the sterling group and the tata group.,0
tech,security warning over  fbi virus  the us federal bureau of investigation is warning that a computer virus is being spread via e-mails that purport to be from the fbi.  the e-mails show that they have come from an fbi.gov address and tell recipients that they have accessed illegal websites. the messages warn that their internet use has been monitored by the fbi s internet fraud complaint center. an attachment in the e-mail contains the virus  the fbi said. the message asks recipients to click on the attachment and answer some questions about their internet use. but rather than being a questionnaire  the attachment contains a virus that infects the recipient s computer  according to the agency. it is not clear what the virus does once it has infected a computer. users are warned never to open attachment from unsolicited e-mails or from people they do not know.   recipients of this or similar solicitations should know that the fbi does not engage in the practice of sending unsolicited e-mails to the public in this manner   the fbi said in a statement. the bureau is investigating the phoney e-mails. the agency earlier this month shut down fbi.gov accounts  used to communicate with the public  because of a security breach. a spokeswoman said the two incidents appear to be unrelated.,4
politics,ukip could sue veritas defectors the uk independence party could take legal action to unseat two london assembly members who defected to robert kilroy silk s veritas party.  damian hockney  now veritas deputy leader  and peter hulme-cross were elected in 2004 on the list system. the party argues the pair should give up their seats as they won them as ukip representatives  not as individuals. mr hockney said the law was clear that those elected on a list who quit their party should keep their seats. ukip chairman petrina holdsworth urged the men to step down from the gla in a letter.  she said:  the party has taken legal advice and it is clear that we could take legal proceedings against you which could result in the return of our seats and/or damages against you.  we would however like you to be given an opportunity to reflect on what you have done  to restore your own credibility with the electorate and return the seats to the party which won them fair and square at the last election.  mr hockney said the law worked in exactly the same way for the gla as it did for other electoral list systems.  the greater london act is clear that if someone resigns who was elected on a list  their party whip the seat belongs to them and not the party.  he said mr hulme-cross and himself had no intention of resigning and added that they felt that it was ukip who were not being true to the electorate. he accused the party of signing up to a deal with the tories in europe  rather than sticking to an independent stance. but the claim was denied by ukip spokesman  who said:  mr hockney s accusations are like his sense of political morals - empty.  veritas was formed by mr kilroy-silk earlier this month after he quit ukip following an unsuccessful bid to take over as leader.,2
business,us data sparks inflation worries wholesale prices in the us rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in january  according to government data.  new figures show the labor department producer price index (ppi) rose by 0.3% - in line with forecasts. but core producer prices  which exclude food and energy costs  surged by 0.8%  the biggest rise since december 1998  increasing inflationary concerns. in contrast  the university of michigan barometer of us retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. the university s index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early february from 95.5 in january  which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the us public. the mixed set of data on friday led to volatile early wall street trade  as the dow jones  standard and poor s 500  and nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory.  the economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the federal reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. the fed has been raising interest rates at a gradual pace since june 2004  in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control.  mr greenspan told congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures.  the ppi would argue for greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace   said joe quinlan  chief market stategist at bank of america capital management.  but this michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending; this could be an indication of that.   consumer spending accounts for 66% of us economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy  which is why the michigan data is closely observed. however on friday  it was overshadowed by the core ppi core figure  which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months  the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years.  the concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core ppi as an impetus for the fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates   said paul cherney  chief market analyst at standard & poor s. but ian shepherdson  chief us economist at high frequency economics  said the ppi report was  much less alarming  than at first glance. one-time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices  which  are no indication of broad ppi pressure   were responsible for the increase  he said. prices for autos and trucks also jumped in january  but shepherdson said  it is a good bet these increases won t stick .,0
business,china had role in yukos split-up china lent russia $6bn (Â£3.2bn) to help the russian government renationalise the key yuganskneftegas unit of oil group yukos  it has been revealed.  the kremlin said on tuesday that the $6bn which russian state bank veb lent state-owned rosneft to help buy yugansk in turn came from chinese banks. the revelation came as the russian government said rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with china. the deal sees rosneft receive $6bn in credits from china s cnpc.  according to russian newspaper vedomosti  these credits would be used to pay off the loans rosneft received to finance the purchase of yugansk. reports said cnpc had been offered 20% of yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead. analysts said one factor that might have influenced the chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from yukos  yugansk s former owner  if cnpc had become a shareholder. rosneft and veb declined to comment.  the two companies [rosneft and cnpc] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries   said russian oil official sergei oganesyan.  there is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years.   the announcements help to explain how rosneft  a medium-sized  indebted  and relatively unknown firm  was able to finance its surprise purchase of yugansk. yugansk was sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines.  the embattled russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a us court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. but yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by rosneft. yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. once the country s richest man  mr khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion.  the deal between rosneft and cnpc is seen as part of china s desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy. china s thirst for products such as crude oil  copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels.  clearly the chinese are trying to get some leverage [in russia]   said dmitry lukashov  an analyst at brokerage aton.  they understand property rights in russia are not the most important rights  and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies.   if the price of oil is fixed under the deal  which is unlikely  it could be very profitable for the chinese   mr lukashov continued.  and rosneft is in desperate need of cash  so it s a good deal for them too.,0
sport,wenger keeping faith with almunia arsene wenger has pledged to keep faith with stand-in keeper manuel almunia for the crunch week which could define arsenal s season.  almunia will start tuesday s champions league group tie against rosenborg and is likely to face chelsea on sunday. wenger said:  you don t think i would take out one goalkeeper for just one game  do you  i don t do that.  i have to give him a run for a few games. it s just that i don t want to make this story bigger than it is.  wenger insists he has complete faith in the 27-year-old spaniard  who was signed last summer from celta vigo as back-up to jens lehmann.   if you look at my career  you will see that i have left many big players out for a long time. i ve done it with dennis bergkamp  kanu  everybody.  it s because it s a goalkeeper  that s all. it s a usual situation for me. you put your best team out  no matter who it is.  for me  it was not a big mistake at old trafford and i wasn t alarmed by what happened against birmingham either.  it s nothing against lehmann. i think he s a great keeper  as is almunia. you can only play one of them.  these people are not robots - they have good periods and less good periods. just because lehmann doesn t play for two or three weeks  or longer or shorter  it doesn t mean i ve lost faith in him.   but former arsenal keeper david seaman believes lehmann has been harshly treated. seaman told the daily mail:  jens is a fantastic keeper. he deserves another chance.  he has made a few mistakes but on form he deserves to be the first-team choice.  with arsenal hit by injuries and suspension  inexperienced midfield pair of mathieu flamini and cesc fabregas will line up against rosenborg but wenger is confident they will prove more than capable.  it puts a lot of pressure on them but it s a good learning process   said wenger.  i m not worried as they are both mentally strong and will put in the needed workrate.   the gunners go into the game boosted by the news that defender sol campbell is on the verge of signing a new deal with the club. and the 30-year-old  whose current contract runs out in the summer  has made it clear he is determined to achieve champions league success with arsenal. campbell said:  it means a lot to me to go through  it s everything. we want to carry on in this competition.  that s where the best teams in europe are. to be in there  playing against these guys and trying to win the trophy  is the first thing in my mind.   meanwhile  thierry henry believes he will be blamed if arsenal fail to qualify for the next stage of the champions league. henry will captain the side in place of the suspended patrick vieira as the gunners seek the required victory over rosenborg. and the striker said:  if we don t win and we go out of the competition  like it or not  it s going to be my fault. that s the way it is.  if the team don t win i know i will be criticised  no matter how i play.,3
entertainment,casino royale is next bond movie casino royale  author ian fleming s first james bond book  is to be the next bond film  with goldeneye director martin campbell behind the camera.  it will be the 21st james bond film to hit the big screen  and speculation has been rife over who will play the lead. casino royale was turned into a spoof spy movie by john huston in 1967  with david niven in the lead role. pierce brosnan led the past four bond films but said producers axed him after offering him the chance to return. among the favourites to take over the coveted role are scottish actor dougray scott  oscar nominee clive owen and australian star hugh jackman. producers say no decision has yet been made on who will become the seventh actor  including niven  to play bond on film. kill bill director quentin tarantino had talked of wanting to take on the casino royale project  and said he had spoken to brosnan about it.  shooting on casino royale is expected to begin once campbell has finished work on the legend of zorro  a sequel to the mask of zorro  starring catherine zeta jones and antonio banderas. producers barbara broccoli and michael g wilson expect the film to be released in 2006.  the script will once again be developed by neal purvis and robert wade who have both worked on two previous bond movies. fleming s book saw the introduction of bond pitted against a russian spy in a game of baccarat. simultaneously  a woman arrives on the scene to take his eye off the game. the novel is one of fleming s most violent and sadistic stories  with 007 suffering a savage beating from his nemesis le chiffre. in addition to the 1967 film  it was also adapted for television in 1954 with actor barry nelson as an americanised  jimmy  bond. mgm vice chairman chris mcgurk said:  martin (campbell) is an incredibly exciting film-maker. goldeneye was a wonderful movie and helped reinvigorate the bond franchise. we re thrilled to have him back to direct the newest bond.  new zealand-born campbell moved to the uk in 1966 and directed tv series such as the professionals  minder and bergerac. his film credits include edge of darkness  vertical limit and beyond borders  which starred angelina jolie and clive owen.,1
sport,wales critical of clumsy grewcock wales coach mike ruddock says england lock danny grewcock needs to review his actions after he kicked dwayne peel.  trouble flared at a ruck in the first half of wales  11-9 win in cardiff as grewcock came recklessly over the top with his boot  leaving peel bloodied. grewcock was sin-binned with wales captain gareth thomas for retaliation.  it s up to the citing commissioner   said ruddock.  i m not saying it s deliberate  but grewcock did a similar thing for bath against leinster.  last june grewcock was banned from rugby for two months for reckless use of a boot in a match against new zealand.  six years earlier  also in new zealand  grewcock became only the second england player to be sent off in tests. the player himself and his captain jason robinson have both said that the clash with peel was accidental.  if the ball is at the back of the ruck and i feel i can step over and disrupt it then i will do that   said grewcock. but ruddock feels that the england man should be more careful.  the boy himself should look at his actions  it was a clumsy piece of footwork   he said.  he s a great player and i don t want to knock him  we won t be calling for the match commissioner to review the incident.  i m not going to go too far with the lad. it could just be a clumsy action and dwayne had just a minor cut.  the referee s interpretation was that grewcock was attempting to step over the ruck.  ruddock also warned his rbs 6 nations championship rivals that his team can make massive improvements.  we created more opportunities and also squandered them by taking more contact and playing more individually   said the coach.  we ve looked through things on the video debrief and there were definitely a lot of chances that we wasted.  in the forthcoming games  ruddock may use penalty hero gavin henson as his first-choice kicker in place of stephen jones.  our first aim was to get gavin settled into the team  but it s something we ll talk about in selection this week   said ruddock.,3
sport,hewitt falls to dent in adelaide lleyton hewitt suffered a shock defeat to taylor dent in the quarter-finals of the australian hardcourt championships in adelaide on friday.  the top seed was a strong favourite for the title but went down 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 to the american. dent will face juan ignacio chela next after the fourth seed was too strong for jurgen melzer. olivier rochus beat third seed nicolas kiefer 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (8-6) 7-5 and will take on second seed joachim johansson. the swede reached the last four by beating compatriot thomas enqvist 6-3 4-6 6-1.  i felt like i was striking the ball much better   said johansson.   i felt like i had a lot of break chances  i didn t take care of them all  but i broke him four times and he only broke me once.  i felt that was the key to get up in the set early.  hewitt played down his defeat and insisted he is focused solely on the australian open  which starts on 17 january.  when you ve been number one in the world for a couple of years and won a couple of slams  you look at the big picture and what motivates you   said hewitt.  that s the grand slams and melbourne s as big for me as any of the four. even if i don t win sydney next week it s no big deal.,3
sport,wenger dejected as arsenal slump arsenal manager arsene wenger claimed their display in the 3-1 defeat against bayern munich was  our worst peformance in the champions league .  kolo toure s late goal gives the gunners hope for the second leg  but wenger said:  the only positive is that we are still in the tie.  the players are really down in the dressing-room. i feel we really turned in a bad performance.  at 3-0 we faced a real struggle  but 3-1 at least gives us a chance.   goalscorer toure was also at fault for two goals  and wenger said:  we need to help toure rebuild his confidence as he is low at the moment.  wenger also tried to stay upbeat himself  adding:  but there is enough time for crying. i could cry - maybe it would be easier - but life goes on.  in this job  you have good and bad nights. this was a bad night - but i still have confidence in the quality of my players  as well as their spirit and desire.  but wenger s bayern counterpart felix magath was in no mood to celebrate either. he said:  i am far from happy despite the win. my players failed to try and score a fourth to kill the tie and then conceded the late goal.   arsenal are fully capable of scoring several goals against us on their own turf.  arsenal keeper jens lehmann  whose personal rivalry with bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn was not helped by the result  said:  do i blame myself for the third goal  as a goalkeeper  i always blame myself.  i just know the goals were very easy against us. in my time here  we have never conceded three easy goals like that - but sometimes it happens.  it would have been impossible to go through at 3-0 - but with the goal we have chances. everything is now possible.,3
entertainment,hollywood hunts hits at sundance the sundance film festival  the movie industry s top destination for uncovering the next independent hits and new talent  opens on thursday.  the event will see screen executives decamp from hollywood to park city  utah  for 11 days to search for low-key movies that could make it big in 2005. open water  napoleon dynamite  garden state and super-size me were all snapped up at last year s festival. but stars like keanu reeves and pierce brosnan also have films showing there. the festival is being opened by a screening of quirky comedy happy endings  starring former friends actress lisa kudrow and maggie gyllenhaal  on thursday.  kudrow s friends co-star  david schwimmer  plays a divorced drunkard in duane hopwood  while brosnan stars as a hit man in comedy the matador. keanu reeves appears in coming-of-age tale thumbsucker while kevin costner and michael keaton are among the other big names whose films are involved. robert redford founded sundance in 1981 and it has gone on to showcase future successes such as reservoir dogs  the blair witch project and the full monty. but it has received criticism that it has become more commercial and mainstream over the years.  as much as the press argues that sundance has completely changed  it hasn t changed that much   festival director geoffrey gilmore said.  it s still a place for discovery. it s a place for common ground among film-makers and audiences more than it is the celebrity stuff.  other films generating interest before this year s festival include hustle & flow  about an aspiring rapper  the squid and the whale  an autobiographical film by writer-director noah baumbach  and comedy/drama pretty persuasion. it also has two new international cinema competitions.,1
business,s korean consumers spending again south korea looks set to sustain its revival thanks to renewed private consumption  its central bank says.  the country s economy has suffered from an overhang of personal debt after its consumers  credit card spending spree. card use fell sharply last year  but is now picking up again with a rise in spending of 14.8% year-on-year.  the economy is now heading upward rather than downward   said central bank governor park seung.  the worst seems to have passed.  mr park s statement came as the bank decided to keep interest rates at an all-time low of 3.25%. it had cut rates in november to help revive the economy  but rising inflation - reaching 0.7% month-on-month in january - has stopped it from cutting further. economic growth in 2004 was about 4.7%  with the central bank predicting 4% growth this year. other indicators are also suggesting that the country is inching back towards economic health. exports - traditionally the driver for expansion in asian economies - grew slower in january than at any time in 17 months. but domestic demand seems to be taking up the slack. consumer confidence has bounced back from a four-year low in january  and retail sales were up 2.1% in december. credit card debt is falling  with only one in 13 of the 48 million cards now in default - down from one in eight at the end of 2003. one of its biggest card issuers  lg card  was rescued from collapse in december  having almost imploded under the weight of its customers  bad debts. the government last year tightened the rules for card lending to keep the card glut under control.,0

business,bbc poll indicates economic gloom citizens in a majority of nations surveyed in a bbc world service poll believe the world economy is worsening.  most respondents also said their national economy was getting worse. but when asked about their own family s financial outlook  a majority in 14 countries said they were positive about the future. almost 23 000 people in 22 countries were questioned for the poll  which was mostly conducted before the asian tsunami disaster. the poll found that a majority or plurality of people in 13 countries believed the economy was going downhill  compared with respondents in nine countries who believed it was improving. those surveyed in three countries were split. in percentage terms  an average of 44% of respondents in each country said the world economy was getting worse  compared to 34% who said it was improving. similarly  48% were pessimistic about their national economy  while 41% were optimistic. and 47% saw their family s economic conditions improving  as against 36% who said they were getting worse.  the poll of 22 953 people was conducted by the international polling firm globescan  together with the program on international policy attitudes (pipa) at the university of maryland.  while the world economy has picked up from difficult times just a few years ago  people seem to not have fully absorbed this development  though they are personally experiencing its effects   said pipa director steven kull.  people around the world are saying:  i m ok  but the world isn t .  there may be a perception that war  terrorism and religious and political divisions are making the world a worse place  even though that has not so far been reflected in global economic performance  says the bbc s elizabeth blunt.  the countries where people were most optimistic  both for the world and for their own families  were two fast-growing developing economies  china and india  followed by indonesia. china has seen two decades of blistering economic growth  which has led to wealth creation on a huge scale  says the bbc s louisa lim in beijing. but the results also may reflect the untrammelled confidence of people who are subject to endless government propaganda about their country s rosy economic future  our correspondent says. south korea was the most pessimistic  while respondents in italy and mexico were also quite gloomy. the bbc s david willey in rome says one reason for that result is the changeover from the lira to the euro in 2001  which is widely viewed as the biggest reason why their wages and salaries are worth less than they used to be. the philippines was among the most upbeat countries on prospects for respondents  families  but one of the most pessimistic about the world economy. pipa conducted the poll from 15 november 2004 to 3 january 2005 across 22 countries in face-to-face or telephone interviews. the interviews took place between 15 november 2004 and 5 january 2005. the margin of error is between 2.5 and 4 points  depending on the country. in eight of the countries  the sample was limited to major metropolitan areas.,0
sport,radcliffe eyes hard line on drugs paula radcliffe has called for all athletes found guilty on drugs charges to be treated as criminals.  the marathon world record holder believes more needs to be done to rid athletics of the  suspicions and innuendoes  which greet any fast time.  doping in sport is a criminal offence and should be treated as such   the 30-year-old told the sunday times.  it not only cheats other athletes but also cheats promoters  sponsors and the general public.   radcliffe s comments come at a time when several american sports stars are under suspicion of steroid use.  being caught in possession of a performance-enhancing drugs should carry a penalty   she added.   the current system does not detect many of the substances being abused by athletes.  this means that often athletes do not know if they are competing on a level playing field  if their hard work and sacrifice is being trumped by an easier scientific route.  often  when an athlete puts in a good performance  they are subjected to suspicions and innuendoes instead of praise.  having been on the receiving end of accusations like this i can testify as to how much this hurts.,3
sport,edwards tips idowu for euro gold world outdoor triple jump record holder and bbc pundit jonathan edwards believes phillips idowu can take gold at the european indoor championships.  idowu landed 17.30m at the british trials in sheffield last month to lead the world triple jump rankings.  it s all down to him  but if he jumps as well as he did in sheffield he could win the gold medal   said edwards.  his ability is undoubted but all his best performances seem to happen in domestic meetings.   idowu made his breakthrough five years ago but so far has only a commonwealth silver medal to his name. edwards himself kept idowu off top spot at the manchester games. but he believes the european indoors in madrid represent a chance for the 26-year-old to prove his credentials as britain s top triple jumper.  he has to start producing at international level and here is the beginning   said edwards.  phillips still needs to be much more consistent. i m sure a victory in madrid will build up his confidence and self-belief that he can be best in the world.  the qualifying round of the men s triple jump in madrid takes place on friday with the final scheduled for saturday. olympic champion christian olsson will not be taking part as he is out for the entire indoor season with an ankle injury.,3
sport,clijsters hope on aussie open kim clijsters has denied reports that she has pulled out of january s australian open because of her persistent wrist injury.  open chief paul mcnamee had said:  kim s wrist obviously isn t going to be rehabilitated.  but her spokesman insisted she had simply delayed submitting her entry.  the doctors are assessing her injury on a weekly basis and if there is no risk she could play. but if there s the least risk she will stay away.  despite being absent from the wta entry list for the tournament  which begins on 17 january  clijsters would be certain to get a wild card if she requested one. clijsters is still ranked 22nd in the world despite only playing a handful of matches last season. the belgian had an operation on her left wrist early in the season but injured it again on her return to the tour. meanwhile  jelena dokic  who used to compete for australia  has opted out of the first grand slam of the season. dokic has not played in the australian open since 2001 when she lost in the first round. but the 21-year-old would have had to rely on a wild card next season because her ranking has tumbled to 127th. four-time champion monica seles  who has not played since last year s french open  is another absentee because of an injured left foot.,3
politics,kilroy-silk quits  shameful  ukip ex-chat show host robert kilroy-silk has quit the uk independence party and accused it of betraying its supporters.  the mep said he was ashamed to have joined the party  which he labelled as a  joke . he plans to stand in the next general election but refused to confirm he is setting up a new political party called veritas - latin for truth. ukip leader roger knapman said he would  break open the champagne   adding:  it was nice knowing him  now  goodbye .  however  he did say the ex-chat show host had been  quite useful initially .  he has remarkable ability to influence people but  sadly  after the (european) election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy-silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him  now  goodbye    mr knapman told bbc radio 4 s today programme. mr knapman rejected the idea mr kilroy-silk posed a threat to ukip and queried why he had failed to confirm rumours he was starting a new political party.  mr kilroy-silk explained his reasons to his east midlands constituents at a meeting in hinckley  leicestershire. his decision came as ukip officials began a process which could have triggered mr kilroy-silk s expulsion. it marks the end of his membership of ukip after just nine months. it began with a flood of publicity which helped ukip into third place in last june s european elections but became dominated by rancour as he tried to take over the party leadership.  mr kilroy-silk accused his fellow ukip meps of being content with growing fat  sitting on their backsides  in brussels. he told bbc news 24:  i tried to change the party  i nagged all the way through the summer to do things  to get moving because i thought it was criminal what they were doing  it was a betrayal.  mr kilroy-silk also told sky news there was  masses of support  for him to form a new party - something he has yet to confirm will happen.  ukip won 12 seats and 16.1% of the vote at the european elections on the back of its call for the uk to leave the european union in his speech  mr kilroy-silk says the result offered ukip an  amazing opportunity  but the party s leadership had done nothing and  gone awol . there were no policies  no energy  no vision and no spokespeople  he said.  the party is going nowhere and i m embarrassed with its allies in europe and i m ashamed to be a member of the party   said mr kilroy-silk.  he said his conviction in britain s right to govern itself had not changed. he would continue that campaign outside ukip when he contested the general election in an east midlands constituency. reports of his new party plans have prompted a formal complaint to ukip s disciplinary committee for bringing the party into  disrepute . on thursday  the party challenged mr kilroy-silk to stand down as an mep so voters can get a genuine ukip candidate.,2

entertainment,ten-year tragedy of missing manic richey edwards  guitarist and lyricist for the manic street preachers  vanished 10 years ago  on 1 february 1995. his disappearance remains one of the most tragic mysteries in rock music.  for his devoted fans  richey edwards was an inspired and inspiring poet  a man who articulated their desperation and despair  who shouted the things most kept hidden. the manic street preachers may only have become stadium-conquering rock giants since his disappearance - but edwards was the figurehead for their first  dangerous and dazzling incarnation. edwards did not feature in the original line-up of the band  though. singer/guitarist james dean bradfield  bassist nicky wire and drummer sean moore were originally accompanied by a rhythm guitarist called flicker. but edwards replaced flicker in time for the band s self-financed debut  suicide alley  after designing the record s artwork.  after becoming a full-time member  edwards became a critical part of the band  writing lyrics and playing guitar - though in many concerts  he was not actually plugged in. but the fiercely intelligent edwards - who name-checked writers such as sylvia plath  george orwell and philip larkin - battled depression  alcohol problems  eating disorders  and self-harm. by the time the band released their third album  the holy bible  in october 1994  edwards had been admitted to hospital with depression. but in his last interview a few months later  seemed to be making plans for the future.  edwards walks out of the embassy hotel in london in the early morning  ahead of the band s us tour to promote the holy bible. in the following days  police issue a missing person alert and his parents  graham and sherry  plead for their son to let them know he is safe and well.  police discover edwards  car in a car park near the severn bridge near bristol - a notorious suicide spot. the discovery leads many to believe he has killed himself. the rest of the band stop touring and recording.  the band play their first concerts since edwards  disappearance as a trio  performing support slots for the stone roses on their uk stadium tour.  the manic street preachers release their first music since edwards  disappearance. a design for life reaches number two in the uk singles chart. the album everything must go follows.  the manics win best band and best album for everything must go at the brit awards.  a fan says she saw edwards in the hippy resort of goa  india. interpol are alerted but do not track him down.  graham and sherry edwards fly to the spanish island of fuerteventura six weeks after reports a man fitting their son s description has been seen in a bar called underground. the report comes to nothing.  edwards  sister rachel makes an emotional tv appeal five years after the disappearance.  i d just like to say to him if he is able to listen that we do love him very much and we d like him to come back - me  mum and dad   she said.  the band play a concert in the cuban capital  havana - the first contemporary western rock band to play there.  on the seventh anniversary of his disappearance  police offer edwards  parents the opportunity to sign a death certificate. they refuse. the big issue magazine  which supports homelessness charities  prints the last known picture of edwards in a fresh plea for information.  a pair of trainers containing human bones washed up on the banks of the river severn have no link to edwards  police say.  the last song written by edwards - a song called judge y self  which was to have been used for the judge dredd film soundtrack - is released on the b-side compilation lipstick traces. a skeleton found by the river severn is not edwards  tests reveal.  the manics  seventh studio album  lifeblood  features a song dedicated to edwards called cardiff afterlife.  the remaining manic street preachers members continue to pay a quarter of the band s royalties into an account held in his name.,1
business,bp surges ahead on high oil price oil giant bp has announced a 26% rise in annual profits to $16.2bn (Â£8.7bn) on the back of record oil prices.  last week  rival shell reported an annual profit of $17.5bn - a record profit for a uk-listed company. bp added that it was increasing its fourth-quarter dividend by 26% to 8.5 cents  and that it would continue with share buybacks. bp chief executive lord browne said the results were strong  both operationally and financially.   the company is earning about $1.8m an hour.  despite the record annual profits figure  bp s performance was below the expectations of some city analysts. however  bp s share price rose 4p or nearly 1% in morning trading to 548p. its profit rise for the year included profits of $3.65bn (Â£1.97bn) for the final three months of 2004 - up from $2.89bn a year ago but below its third quarter.  speaking on the bbc s today programme on tuesday  lord browne said the profits were not solely down to the high oil price alone.   the profits are up more than the price of oil is up   he said. lord browne pointed out that bp was reaping the benefits of its investment in oil exploration.  we have spent many years buying (assets) when the price is low   he said. the company has made new discoveries in egypt  the gulf of mexico and angola.  however  lord browne rejected calls for a windfall tax on his company s huge profits  saying that in the north sea it paid progressively more tax  the more profits it made. lord browne believes oil prices will remain quite high. currently above $40 a barrel  he said:  the price of oil will be well supported above $30 a barrel for the medium term.  bp put production for the year at 3.997 billion barrels of oil  up 10% on 2003  but slightly lower than the four billion barrels it had initially aimed for.,0
business,quake s economic costs emerging asian governments and international agencies are reeling at the potential economic devastation left by the asian tsunami and floods.  world bank president james wolfensohn has said his agency is  only beginning to grasp the magnitude of the disaster  and its economic impact. the tragedy has left at least 25 000 people dead  with sri lanka  thailand  india and indonesia worst hit. some early estimates of reconstruction costs are starting to emerge. millions have been left homeless  while businesses and infrastructure have been washed away.  economists believe several of the 10 countries hit by the giant waves could see a slowdown in growth.  in sri lanka  some observers have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. for thailand  that figure is much lower at 0.1%. governments are expected to take steps  such as cutting taxes and increasing spending  to facilitate a recovery.   with the enormous displacement of people...there will be a serious relaxation of fiscal policy   glenn maguire  chief economist for the region at societe generale  told agence france presse.  the economic impact of it will certainly be large  but it should not be enough to derail the momentum of the region in 2005   he said.  first and foremost this is a human tragedy.  india s economy  however  is less likely to slow because the areas hit are some of the least developed. the regional giant has enjoyed strong growth in 2004. but india now faces other problems  with aid workers under pressure to ensure a clean supply of water and sanitation to prevent an outbreak of disease.  thailand s prime minister thaksin shinawatra has estimated the destruction at 20bn baht ($510m). analysts said that figure is likely to rise and the country s tourist industry is likely to be hardest hit. thailand s fishing and real estate sectors also will be affected by sunday s 9.0 magnitude earthquake  which sent huge waves from malaysia to africa. malaysia said as many as 1 000 fishermen will be affected and that damage to the industry will be  significant   agence france presse reported. rapid rebuilding will be key to limiting the impact of the tragedy.  in three months  we should rebuild 70% of the damage in the three worst hit provinces   said juthamas siriwan  governor of the tourism authority of thailand. the outlook for sri lanka is less optimistic  with analysts predicting that the country s tourist industry will struggle to recovery quickly. tourism is a vital to many developing countries  providing jobs for 19 million people in the south east asian region  according to the world travel and tourism council (wttc).,0

politics,strike threat over pension plans millions of public service workers could strike if ministers scrap their final salary pension scheme and make them work longer  warn union leaders.  the cabinet office has confirmed it is reviewing the current pension system  prompting unions representing 4.5m workers to threaten united action. they believe the plans include raising the mandatory retirement age for public service workers from 60 to 65. the government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made.  it is thought the proposed overhaul  due on thursday  could mean pensions could be based on a  career average  salary. for each year served  staff currently get one eightieth of their highest salary in the final three years. ministers will be anxious to avoid mass strike action in the lead-up to the next general election  which is widely expected next may. in a statement on sunday  the cabinet office said it was reviewing the civil service pension scheme  and hoped to announce proposals soon.  unions will of course be consulted about any proposed changes.  public sector pension schemes need to remain affordable and sustainable. people are living longer and pensions are getting more expensive.  to maintain the long-term affordability of our pension scheme  the government announced in its green paper on pensions that pension age would rise from 60 to 65.  on monday  tony blair s official spokesman declined to say whether the prime minister backed the plans. he said:  what s important is that there s a process going on  it s out for consultation at the moment  let s wait for that process to complete itself.   there is already widespread anger over the chancellor s plans to get rid of more than 100 000 civil servants. now public service unions are united against the plans and the trades union congress is discussing the issue next monday. dave prentis  general secretary of unison  said changes to pension provisions for workers in the public sector would mean they had to pay in more but would still face a raw deal.  members working in the nhs or for local government have never had high pay or city bonuses  but they could look forward to a decent pension - now all that is being taken away   he said.  what really riles me is the breathtaking hypocrisy of mps who recently voted themselves the best pension scheme in europe  but say they can t afford it for anyone else.  this is a position that unison cannot accept and will oppose. it will lead to conflict between unison and the government  if not this year then next.   mr prentis said workers did not want to go on strike and called for talks between unions and the highest level of government. mark serwotka  from the public and commercial services union said there should be a co-ordinated one day strike unless there was a government rethink. the fire brigades union said the government was planning to cut ill health retirement benefits for firefighters and other measures to chip away at pensions. pensions officer paul woolstenholmes said:  the pensions of millions of public sector workers are under threat - apart from mps and judges who have the most generous pensions arrangements in the country.,2
tech,firefox browser takes on microsoft microsoft s internet explorer has a serious rival in the long-awaited firefox 1.0 web browser  which has just been released.  few people get excited when some new software is released  especially when the program is not a game or a music or movie player. but the release of the first full version of firefox has managed to drum up a respectable amount of pre-launch fervour. fans of the software have banded together to raise cash to pay for an advert in the new york times announcing that version 1.0 of the browser is available. the release of firefox 1.0 on 9 november might even cause a few heads to turn at microsoft because the program is steadily winning people away from the software giant s internet explorer browser.  firefox has been created by the mozilla foundation which was started by former browser maker netscape back in 1998. much of the development work done since then has gone into firefox which made its first appearance under this name in february. earlier incarnations  but which had the same core technology  were called phoenix and firebird. since then the software has been gaining praise and converts  not least because of the large number of security problems that have come to light in microsoft s internet explorer. rivals to ie got a boost in late june when two us computer security organisations warned people to avoid the microsoft program to avoid falling victim to a serious vulnerability.  internet monitoring firm websidestory has charted the growing population of people using the firefox browser and says it is responsible for slowly eroding the stranglehold of ie. before july this year  according to websidestory  internet explorer was used by about 95% of web surfers. that figure had remained static for years. in july the ie using population dropped to 94.7% and by the end of october stood at 92.9%. the mozilla foundation claims that firefox has been downloaded almost eight million times and has publicly said it would be happy to garner 10% of the windows- using  net-browsing population. firefox is proving popular because  at the moment  it has far fewer security holes than internet explorer and has some innovations lacking in microsoft s program. for instance  firefox allows the pages of different websites to be arranged as tabs so users can switch easily between them. it blocks pop-ups  has a neat way of finding text on a page and lets you search through the pages you have browsed.  one of the most powerful features of firefox is the many hundreds of extras  or extensions  produced for it. the mozilla foundation is an open source organisation which means that the creators of the browser are happy for others to play around with the core code for the program. this has resulted in many different add-ons or extensions for the browser which now include everything from a version of the familiar google toolbar to a homeland security monitor that keep users aware of current threat levels. firefox  which used to be called firebird and before that phoenix  also has a growing number of vocal net-based fans. a campaign co-ordinated by the spread firefox website attempted to raise the $50 000 needed for a full page advert in the new york times. the campaign set itself a target of recruiting 2500 volunteers. ten days in to the campaign 10 000 people had signed up and now about $250 000 has been raised. the ad is due to run sometime in a three-week period in late november/early december. the surplus cash will be used to help keep the mozilla foundation running. microsoft is facing a growing challenge to ie s hold on the web using population. from alternative browsers such as opera  safari  amaya and even netscape.,4
business,the  ticking budget  facing the us the budget proposals laid out by the administration of us president george w bush are highly controversial. the washington-based economic policy institute  which tends to be critical of the president  looks at possible fault lines. us politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy. without major changes in current policies and political prejudices  the federal budget simply cannot hold together. news coverage of the bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts  but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs. from the standpoint of the big fiscal trends  the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come. under direct threat will be the federal government s ability to make good on its debts to the social security trust fund. as soon as 2018  the fund will begin to require some cash returns on its bond holdings in order to finance all promised benefits.  the trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt  which will grow in 10 years  by conservative estimates  to more than half the nation s total annual output.  this upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government  putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business. even now  a growing share of us borrowing is from abroad. the us government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of japan and china  among other nations. this does not bode well for us influence in the world. the decline of the dollar is a warning sign that current economic trends cannot continue. the dollar is already sinking. before too long  credit markets are likely to react  and interest rates will creep upwards. that will be the shock.  interest-sensitive industries will feel pain immediately - sectors such as housing  automobiles  other consumer durables  agriculture  and small business. some will recall the news footage of angry farmers driving their heavy equipment around the us capitol in the late 1970s. there will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget. the public outcry will force congress to act. whether it will act wisely is another matter. how did this happen   by definition  the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending - but this neutral description doesn t adequately capture the current situation. federal revenues are at 1950s levels  while spending remains where it has been in recent decades - much higher. in addition  the united states has two significant military missions. the bush administration s chosen remedy is the least feasible one. reducing domestic spending  or eliminating  waste  fraud and abuse  is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem. indeed  if congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way  there would hardly be any such spending left. law enforcement  space exploration  environmental clean-up  economic development  the small business administration  housing  veterans  benefits  aid to state and local governments would all but disappear. it s fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed. the biggest spending growth areas are defence (including homeland security)  and health care for the elderly and the poor. to some extent  increases in these areas are inevitable. the us population is aging  and the nation does face genuine threats in the world. but serious savings can only be found where the big money is. savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system  public and private. brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill-serve the nation s elderly and indigent.  on the revenue side  the lion s share of revenue lost to tax cuts enacted since 2000 will have to be replaced.  some rearranging could hold many people harmless and focus most of the pain on those with relatively high incomes. finally  blind allegiance to a balanced budget will have to be abandoned. there is no good reason to fixate on it  anyway. moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely. borrowing for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years makes sense. the sooner we face that reality  the sooner workable reforms can be pursued. first on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue  simplify the tax code  and restore some fairness eroded by the bush tax cuts. second should be a dispassionate re-evaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years  much of it unrelated to afghanistan  iraq  or terrorism. third must be the start of a serious debate on large-scale health care reform. one thing is certain - destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the us economy and government for the challenges of this new century.,0
entertainment,cult band kasabian surge forward indie dance band kasabian built up a cult following throughout 2004 to secure three brit award nominations.  the four-piece leicester band blends dark electronics with rock  earning kasabian places on the best british group  rock act and live act shortlists. they have also earned a reputation as outspoken and charismatic  in contrast to fellow brit nominees such as keane and snow patrol.  british music needs a kick up the arse and britain needs a new band to breathe life into the british people again   declared kasabian s singer tom meighan.   no-one s doing it at the minute. music feels like it s in the afterlife right now. we don t want people to give up on it.  the serpent s going to rise from the sea and scare all the pirates away!  meighan grew up in leicester with kasabian songwriter/guitarist sergio pizzorno and bassist chris edwards  a trio which began making music from the age of 17.  they enlisted guitarist and keyboard player christopher karloff after spotting him in a pub.  we saw his long sideburns and thought  hey  he looks the part  we ll ask him    said meighan. inspired by britpop and a mutual love of hardcore  an early 1990s genre that fused house music with hip hop beats and a dark sensibility  they added an electronic element to the traditional guitar sound.  we got a computer and we cut rock n roll up  because there s no point in going back to how it was   said meighan.  it s all about new ideas and creativity.   the band s original approach is reflected in its name  inspired by linda kasabian - the getaway driver of us serial killer charles manson. coincidentally it is also the armenian term for  butcher . kasabian moved into a remote farmhouse in rutland to record their debut album  benefiting from its isolation but also managing to sneak in a few parties while they were there. signed to the rca record label  kasabian tested the water with two singles  club foot and lsf  which reached numbers 19 and 10 in the uk singles chart respectively.  they built up their following on the summer festival circuit  opening both glastonbury and t in the park  and at a series of  guerilla gigs  at unusual venues including half time orange  a pub next to leicester city football club s headquarters. kasabian s self-titled album was released last september to widespread critical acclaim  its indie dance stance drawing comparisons to the stone roses  primal scream and the happy mondays.  regarding it as  both a fiery assertion of rock  n  roll ethics and proof that a siege mentality is alive and well in the badlands of rutland water   the nme s praise was typical of the album s reception. as 2004 progressed kasabian would score a further two hits - processed beats and cutt off - and embark upon a well-received uk tour.  we take our music seriously  definitely  but we want to have fun with it   said pizzorno.  this is not a job to us   added meighan.  this is the best life we could ever have. this is what it s all about and without it we d be lost souls. but music needs us as well.,1
sport,mcclaren targets champions league middlesbrough boss steve mcclaren believes his side can clinch a top-four spot in the premiership and secure qualification for the champions league.  after their 3-2 win over manchester city  mcclaren said:  we are playing exciting football  it s a magnificent result to keep us in the top five.  but how well we do depends how often we can get our best team out.  once we got the third goal it should have been four or five but we nearly paid for it in the end.  mcclaren also praised winger stewart downing and strikers jimmy floyd hasselbaink and mark viduka  who both ended barren runs in front of goal. he added:  if stewart keeps playing like this sven-goran eriksson has got to pick him.  and the strikers scored great goals  the combination play between them shows they want to play with each other and they are trying.,3
entertainment,church urges nelly show boycott church ministers are trying to prevent rapper nelly performing in arkansas  saying they do not want his  vile and filthy lyrics  in their town.  more than 20 jonesboro ministers urged music fans to boycott nelly s 12 march concert at arkansas state university in a bid to have it cancelled.  jonesboro is a wonderful city because of what does not come here   said the reverend adrian rodgers. but a venue spokesman said more than 5 500 tickets had been sold so far.  mr rodgers  of the fullness of joy church  said he was concerned about the rapper s lyrics that include references to drugs  sex and violence  and songs that the minister said were demeaning to women. ministers were worried that bringing such acts to jonesboro would lead to problems.  tear the tickets up   mr rodgers said.  do not go and do not allow your children to go.   tim dean  director of the arkansas state university venue  said ticket sales had been brisk.  it would appear that with ticket sales over 5 000  many others have expressed their right to find nelly s music entertaining and worth spending their time and money on   he said. nelly has sold more than 30 million singles and albums worldwide  and in september 2004 simultaneously occupied the number one and two positions in the us albums chart. he has had 12 uk hit singles  including hot in herre  dilemma and recent number one over and over.,1
sport,barcelona title hopes hit by loss barcelona s pursuit of the spanish title took a blow on sunday as they fell to a 2-0 defeat at home to atletico madrid.  fernando torres gave athletico an ideal start with a goal in the first minute. ronaldino wasted a second-half chance to equalise for barca when he put a penalty wide  but torres made no such mistake with a last-minute spot-kick. the defeat  coupled with real madrid s 4-0 win over espanyol on saturday  reduces barca s lead to four points. former everton midfielder thomas gravesen scored his first goal for real in the comfortable victory at the bernabeu. zinedine zidane had opened the scoring before raul bagged a brace. gravesen  who replaced zidane  completed the scoring in the 84th minute with a low shot. david beckham  watched by sven-goran eriksson  came off in the 67th minute with a shoulder injury but should be fit for england s game against holland. england team-mate michael owen came on for raul after 76 minutes with the game already won. real have now won six consecutive primera liga games since coach wanderley luxemburgo took charge.,3
sport,federer joins all-time greats the last year has seen one player dominate men s tennis  and one country dominate the women s game.  roger federer became the first man since mats wilander in 1988 to win three grand slams in one season. and after anastasia myskina became the first russian woman to win a grand slam at the french open  two more followed at wimbledon and the us open. meanwhile  briton tim henman enjoyed his best year  while greg rusedski fought back superbly from adversity. federer began the year as world number one and holder of the wimbledon and masters cup titles  and set about conquering new ground. the swiss sounded warning of the dominance to come at the australian open.  he ripped through the draw before beating marat safin in the final. andy roddick was the only player to put up any real resistance at wimbledon  and federer s performance against lleyton hewitt in the us open final was breathtaking. federer again got the better of hewitt in the season-ending masters cup. his victory in houston proved to be his 13th successive win in a final  an open era record. the only major let-down was a third-round loss to gustavo kuerten at the french open  and roland garros will be his main target in 2005.  there was also a surprise loss to the unheralded tomas berdych at the olympic games  which saw chile dominate as nicoals massu took the singles and then paired up with fernando gonzaelz to win doubles gold. another major trophy that looks beyond federer is the davis cup  which was won by spain in a 3-2 home success over the usa in seville. roddick struggled on the clay  losing to rafael nadal on the opening day before going down to carlos moya in the all-important fourth rubber.  henman broke new ground by reaching the semis on clay at the french open - a stunning effort - and also at the us open. a quarter-final defeat to mario ancic at wimbledon was disappointing for the limp manner of the briton s defeat  but he remains optimistic of going further next year.  british number two rusedski endured a rollercoaster year  returning to the circuit after being cleared of a doping offence in march. with his ranking down at 168  many feared the 31-year-old s career was over  but he battled back in the second half of the season to re-enter the top 50. the russian women finally delivered on their long-recognised promise in 2004  with myskina  maria sharapova and svetlana kuznetsova winning grand slams  before taking the season-ending fed cup. but while the young russians were on the way up  it was a different story for the belgians and the williams sisters. only veteran lindsay davenport held the new wave at bay  a stunning run of form after wimbledon taking her to number one ahead of amelie mauresmo  whose grand slam drought goes on. the year started in regulation fashion as justine henin-hardenne beat compatriot kim clijsters at the australian open.  a virus ruined the rest of henin-hardenne s year  although she was fit enough to win olympic gold  but clijsters had an even more miserable 2004. she suffered a serious wrist injury and then announced the end of her relationship with lleyton hewitt  and will be happy to see the year end. in their absence  myskina thrashed elena dementieva in a historic  but woeful  all-russian final at the french open. wimbledon was a more refreshing affair as sharapova captivated sw19  showing nerves of steel as she battled past davenport and serena williams to take the title.  davenport was a strong favourite for the us open but  hampered by injury  lost to the powerful and unflappable kuznetsova in the semis. kuznetsova went on to give dementieva another grand slam final thrashing  with the latter s wayward serve becoming one of the talking points of the year. with the russians still improving  the likes of henin-hardenne  clijsters  davenport  mauresmo  venus and serena will need to be fully fit and motivated in 2005. and it may take their compatriot safin to challenge federer on the men s side.,3
business,firms pump billions into pensions employers have spent billions of pounds propping up their final salary pensions over the past year  research suggests.  a survey of 280 schemes by incomes data services  (ids) said employer contributions had increased from Â£5.5bn to Â£8.2bn a year  a rise of 49.7%. companies facing the biggest deficits had raised their pension contributions by 100% or more  ids said. many firms are struggling to keep this type of scheme open  because of rising costs and increased liabilities. a final salary scheme  also known as a defined benefit scheme  promises to pay a pension related to the salary the scheme member is earning when they retire.  the rising cost of maintaining such schemes has led many employers to replace final salary schemes with money purchase  or defined contribution  schemes. these are less risky for employers. under money purchase schemes  employees pay into a pension fund which is used to buy an annuity - a policy which pays out an income until death - on retirement.  ids said there were some schemes in good health.  but  in many cases  firms had been forced to top up funds to tackle  yawning deficits . the level of contributions paid by employers has increased gradually since the late 1990s. in 1998/99  for example  contributions rose by 4.7% and in 2002/03 by 8.6%. in contrast  between 1996 and 1998  some employers cut their contribution levels. helen sudell  editor of the ids pensions service  said the rise in contributions was  staggering  and the highest ever recorded by ids.  we have warned before that the widespread closure of final salary schemes to new entrants is just the beginning of a much bigger movement away from paternalistic provision   said ms sudell.  with figures like this there can be little doubt that many employers will have to reduce future benefits at some point for those staff still in these schemes.,0
tech,warning over tsunami aid website net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims.  the site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official disasters emergency committee webpage. however  dec has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it. the site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster.  the link to the website is contained in a spam e-mail that is currently circulating. the message s subject line reads  urgent tsunami earthquake appeal  and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts. the web address of the fake site is decuk.org which could be close enough to the official www.dec.org.uk address to confuse some people keen to donate. patricia sanders  spokeswoman for the disaster emergency committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the computer crime unit at scotland yard to help get it shut down. she said the spam e-mails directing people to the site started circulating two days ago shortly after the domain name of the site was registered. it is thought that the fake site is being run from romania. ms sanders said dec had contacted us net registrars who handle domain ownership and the net hosting firm that is keeping the site on the web.  dec was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation. bt and dec s hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down  she said.  ms sanders said sending out spam e-mail to solicit donations was not dec s style and that it would never canvass support in this way. she said that dec hoped to get the fake site shut down as soon as possible. all attempts by the bbc news website to contact the people behind the site have failed. none of the e-mail addresses supplied on the site work and the real owner of the domain is obscured in publicly available net records. this is not the first attempt to cash in on the outpouring of goodwill that has accompanied appeals for tsunami aid. one e-mail sent out in early january came from someone who claimed that he had lost his parents in the disaster and was asking for help moving an inheritance from a bank account in the netherlands. the con was very similar to the familiar nigerian forward fee fraud e-mails that milk money out of people by promising them a cut of a much larger cash pile. other scam e-mails included a link to a website that supposedly let people donate money but instead loaded spyware on their computers that grabbed confidential information. in a monthly report anti-virus firm sophos said that two e-mail messages about the tsunami made it to the top 10 hoax list during january. another tsunami-related e-mail is also circulating that carries the zar worm which tries to spread via the familiar route of microsoft s outlook e-mail program. anyone opening the attachment of the mail will have their contact list plundered by the worm keen to find new addresses to send itself to.,4
business,troubled marsh under sec scrutiny the us stock market regulator is investigating troubled insurance broker marsh & mclennan s shareholder transactions  the firm has said.  the securities and exchange commission has asked for information about transactions involving holders of 5% or more of the firm s shares. marsh has said it is co-operating fully with the sec investigation. marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the new york attorney-general into whether insurers rigged the market. since that inquiry was launched in october  marsh has replaced its chief executive and held a boardroom shake-out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board. prosecutors allege that marsh - the world s biggest insurance broker - and other us insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover. this is the issue at the heart of the inquiry by new york s top law officer  eliot spitzer  and a separate prosecution of five insurers by the state of california. the sec s investigation into so-called related party transactions includes dealings in the trident funds  managed by mmc capital  the company s private equity firm. marsh s new chief executive  michael cherkasky  is trying to negotiate a settlement with mr spitzer. mr spitzer has built up a reputation as a fierce critic and campaigner against corporate america s misdeeds.  the uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies - standard & poor s  moody s and fitch - to downgrade marsh in recent weeks. according to the financial times  insurance analysts are now questioning whether marsh will be able to maintain its strong record of earning growth as they draw up forecasts for the first quarter of next year. doubts also exist over how much the company may have to pay regulators and lawyers to put the scandal behind.,0
politics,labour s four little words labour has unveiled the four little words that will form the heart of its general election campaign which  for those just returned from the planet galifray  is  looming .  the slogan  britain forward not back  (no  it s not an instruction from one of those inter-planetary time lords) is to become as much a part of our daily lives as the sky - it s always there but we mostly stop noticing. the word  britain  is cast on a red background - a nod to old labour.  forward  is in italics and cunningly slopes forward and  along with  not back   is set against a mushy pea green background. as one of the journalists assembled at the unveiling declared  it was all very post modern  or something. great use of colour. those ad men really do earn their money. and  coincidentally  the ad men who came up with the abandoned flying pigs and so-called  fagin  posters which caused tory protests have not been sacked but  as election supremo alan milburn declared   are doing a very good job .  mr milburn  in the latest in his series of pre-election-campaign campaigning  explained the slogan was the reaction to polling which suggests the public believe labour and tony blair are the future while michael howard and the tories would take the country backwards.  not many people talk about the years before 1997 as the good old days   he declared. it would be an aggressive campaign because things would inevitably boil down to a choice between labour and the tories.  nobody  he claimed  could picture liberal democrat leader charles kennedy walking up downing street the day after polling. they could  however  picture michael howard or  of course  tony blair doing it. so it was only right that the campaign concentrated on rigorously examining the opposition s policies and past record. and tony blair would be in the very front line of that campaign  he said.  between now and the election the prime minister will be spending more time out of london than in it but in britain  not overseas   he promised.  he will be leading the domestic debate from the front  listening  taking the flak.  so  let s get on with it then.,2
business,yukos accused of lying to court russian oil firm yukos lied to a us court in an attempt to stop the russian government selling off its key production unit  the court has heard.  the unit  yugansk  was sold to pay off a $27.5bn (Â£14.5bn) back tax bill. yukos argued that since it had a us subsidiary and local bank accounts  the us court could declare it bankrupt and stop the auction of yugansk. but deutsche bank - itself a target of a yukos lawsuit - said documents had been backdated to strengthen the case.  deutsche bank s evidence came on the first day of a two-day hearing in houston. its lawyer  hugh ray  told the court that yukos had claimed it had transferred $27m into two texas bank accounts opened by its new us subsidiary. by doing so  he said  the firm had intended to reinforce its us presence - and thus its chances of getting its case heard in us courts. but he said that the papers documenting the transaction were not drawn up till weeks after yukos made its bankruptcy application on 14 december  and then backdated.  yukos chief financial officer bruce misamore  who had moved to the us in early december to set up yukos usa  acknowledged the point. he said the discrepancy was only in the paperwork  but that money had indeed been transferred on 14 december. even so  he told the court that only $480 000 had been in the accounts that day  with the rest arriving a day later.  deutsche bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by yukos. it had agreed to loan to an arm of russian state gas firm gazprom the money to bid for yuganskneftegaz  as the yukos unit is formally known. the sale went ahead  despite an order from the us bankruptcy court ordered that it should be stopped. in the end  the auction was won by an unknown shell company for $9.4bn - much less than most assessments of its value - before ending up in the hands of state-controlled oil firm rosneft. rosneft  meanwhile  has agreed to merge with gazprom  bringing a large chunk of russia s very profitable oil business back under state control.  yukos maintains that it filed for bankruptcy in the us because it feared it would not be able to do so in russia. it also said that in the event of going bust  it could offer the chance of restructuring.  it gives us a kind of life after death alternative   said yukos chief executive steven theede. yukos is currently suing four companies - gazprom  its unit gazpromneft  rosneft and the shell company which won the bidding - for their part in yugansk s disposal. it has also threatened to sue the russian government for $28bn. analysts have questioned whether a us court has any jurisdiction over russian companies  while moscow officials have dismissed yukos  legal wrangling as meaningless. yukos claims that the rights of its shareholders have been ignored and that is has been punished for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky  once russia s richest man  is in prison  having been charged with fraud and tax evasion and repeatedly denied bail.,0

business,uk  risks breaking golden rule  the uk government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it wants to avoid breaking its  golden rule   a report suggests.  the rule states that the government can borrow cash only to invest  and not to finance its spending projects. the national institute of economic and social research (niesr) claims that taxes need to rise by about Â£10bn if state finances are to be put in order. the treasury said its plans were on track and funded until 2008. according to niesr  if the government s current economic cycle runs until march 2006 then it is  unlikely  the golden rule will be met. should the cycle end a year earlier  then the chances improve to  50/50 . either way  fiscal tightening is needed  niesr said.  the report is the latest to call into question the viability of government spending projections. earlier this month  accountancy firm ernst & young said that chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown s forecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic.  it claimed revenues were likely to be Â£6bn below estimates by the end of the tax year despite the economy growing in line with forecasts. a treasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims  saying it was  on track to meeting spending rules and the golden rule in the current cycle and beyond .  spending plans have been set out until 2008 and they are fully affordable.  other than its warning on possible tax hikes  the niesr report was optimistic about the state of the uk and global economy.  it said the recent record-busting surge in oil prices would have a limited effect on worldwide expansion  saying that if anything the  world economy will continue to grow strongly . global gross domestic product (gdp) is tipped to be 4.1% this year  dipping to 4% in 2005  before picking up again to 4.2% in 2006. the us will continue to drive expansion until 2006  albeit at a slightly slower rate  as will be the case in japan. hinting at better times for uk exporters  niesr said the euro zone  is expected to pick up speed .  growth in britain also is set to accelerate  it forecast.  despite weak growth in the third quarter  the forces sustaining the upswing remain intact and the economy will expand robustly in 2005 and 2006   niesr said  adding that  the economy will become better balanced over the next two years as exports stage a recovery . gdp is expected at 3.2% in 2004  and 2.8% in both 2005 and 2006. the main cloud on the horizon  niesr said  was the uk s much analysed and fretted over property market.,0
tech,britons fed up with net service a survey conducted by pc pro magazine has revealed that many britons are unhappy with their internet service.  they are fed up with slow speeds  high prices and the level of customer service they receive. 17% of readers have switched suppliers and a further 16% are considering changing in the near future. it is particularly bad news for bt  the uk s biggest internet supplier  with almost three times as many people trying to leave as joining.  a third of the 2 000 broadband users interviewed were fed up with their current providers but this could be just the tip of the iceberg thinks tim danton  editor of pc pro magazine.  we expect these figures to leap in 2005. every month the prices drop  and more and more people are trying to switch   he said. the survey found that bt and tiscali have been actively dissuading customers from leaving by offering them a lower price when they phone up to cancel their subscription. some readers were offered a price drop just 25p more expensive than that offered by an alternative operator  making it hardly worth while swapping.  other found themselves tied into 12-month contracts. broadband has become hugely competitive and providers are desperate to hold on to customers. 12% of those surveyed found themselves unable to swap at all.  we discovered a huge variety of problems  but one of the biggest issues is the current supplier withholding the information that people need to give to their new supplier   said tim danton  editor of pc pro.  this breaks the code of practice  but because that code is voluntary there s nothing we or ofcom can do to help   he said. there is a vast choice of internet service providers in the uk now and an often bewildering array of broadband packages. with prices set to drop even further in coming months mr danton advises everyone to shop around carefully.  if you just stick with your current connection then there s every chance you re being ripped off   he warned.,4
tech,gadget show heralds mp3 season partners of those who love their hi-tech gear may want to get their presents in early as experts predict a gadget shortage this christmas.  with apple s ipod topping wish lists again  there may not be enough ipod minis to go round  predicts oliver irish  editor of gadget magazine stuff.  the ipod mini is likely to be this year s tracey island   said mr irish. stuff has compiled a list of the top 10 gadgets for 2004 and the ipod is at number one.  for anyone bewildered by the choice of gadgets on the market  stuff and what hi-fi  are hosting a best-of gadget show in london this weekend. star of the show will be sony s qrio robot  an all-singing  all-dancing  football-playing man-machine who can even hold intelligent conversations.  but he is not for sale and sony has no commercial plans for the robot.  he will greet visitors and is flying in from japan. he probably has his own airplane seat  that is how highly sony prize him   said mr irish. also on display will be a virtual keyboard which projects itself onto any flat surface. the event will play host to a large collection of digital music players  from companies such as creative  sony and philips as well as the ubiquitously fashionable ipod from apple. suggestions that it could be a gaming or wireless christmas are unlikely to come true as mp3 players remain the most popular stocking filler  said mr irish.  demand is huge and apple has promised that it can supply enough but people might struggle to get their hands on ipod minis   said mr irish.  for those who like their gadgets to be multi-talented  the gizmondo  a powerful gaming console with gps and gprs  that also doubles up as an mp3 player  movie player and camera  could be a must-have.  what is impressive is how much it can do and how well it can do them   said mr irish. this christmas  gadgets will not be an all-male preserve.  women will be getting gadgets from husbands and boyfriends as well as buying them for themselves   said mr irish.  gadgets nowadays are lifestyle products rather than just for geeks.,4
politics,police probe bnp mosque leaflet police are investigating a british national party leaflet posted to homes in south wales opposing plans for a new mosque.  anti-racism campaigners in swansea have handed copies to south wales police. swansea s muslim community is raising money to open a new mosque and community centre in the former st andrews united reform church. the building on george street has been derelict since the 1980s.  taha idris  director of the swansea bay race equality council  said his organisation contacted police after receiving complaints from the public.  i m quite shocked to see this sort of leaflet by the bnp in swansea   he said.   the bnp has tried in the past to get into swansea and this is another example of them trying again.  i am in no doubt that the bnp are not needed and not wanted here.  a south wales police spokeswoman confirmed that they were looking at the contents of the leaflet. according to the bnp s website  they have been posted to homes in the castle ward. the bnp website carries a photograph of party leader nick griffin - who lives near welshpool  mid wales - delivering the leaflet. the bnp has denied it is trying to stir up hatred of any race or religion  but argues that they should be able to debate this without fear of arrest. swansea unite against fascism (uaf) is meeting this week to plan a campaign. following the death earlier this year of kalan kawa karim  an iraqi kurd living in swansea  it organised an anti-racism march in the city that was supported by more than 1 000 people. it is planning its own mail shot campaign and may launch a petition in support of the plans for the mosque.  andy richards  of swansea uaf  said the leaflet was exactly what he had come to expect from the bnp.   the people of swansea will not put up with this.  swansea s muslim community bought the former church  just across the road from the existing mosque on st helen s road  in the late 1990s. mr idris said the community was now raising money to renovate the building.  it is a landmark building in swansea and would otherwise just crumble   he said.  it is the ideal opportunity for the building to be restored and used in the proper manner.  it will be a muslim community centre. it s a holistic place used for education  weddings  deaths and births.  he said space was limited in the current mosque and on some occasions muslims had to travel to llanelli for cultural events.,2
entertainment,totp turns to elvis impersonator top of the pops has turned to the star of elvis presley musical jailhouse rock after the late rock legend scooped the uk s 1 000th number one single.  mario kombou  who plays the presley role on stage  will sing one night on friday s bbc one show as producers are unable to use presley video footage. it is his second number one in a row. the show used presley photos last week. presley will feature in the charts for several more months as all 18 of his original uk chart-toppers are reissued.  a top of the pops spokesperson said:  it s a very special number one as it s the uk s 1 000th.  we wanted to pay tribute to elvis in the best way we knew how  so we thought getting a professional would be the best way for top of the pops to do that.  kombou is likely to appear on the show again next week as the next presley re-release  a fool such as i  is on course to give him his third number one in three weeks. kombou plays vince everett in jailhouse rock - the same role presley played in the 1957 film of the same name.,1

tech,set your television to wow television started off as a magical blurry image. then came the sharpness  the colour and the widescreen format. now the tv set is taking another leap forward into a crystal clear future  although those in europe will have to be patient.  after years of buzz about high-definition tv (hdtv) it is finally taking off in a handful of countries around the world  mainly the us and japan. if you believe the hype  then hdtv will so wow you  that you will never want to go back to your old telly.  hdtv is just the latest must-have technology in viewers  homes   says jo flaherty  a senior broadcaster with the cbs network in the us. all television images are made up of pixels  going across the screen  and scan lines going down. british tv pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels. by contrast  hdtv offers up to 1 080 active lines  with each line made up of 1 920 pixels. the result is a picture which can be up to six times as sharp as standard tv. but to get the full impact  programmes need to be broadcast in this format and you need a hdtv set to receive them. most new computer displays are already capable of handling high-resolution pictures. viewers in japan  the us  australia  canada and south korea are already embracing the new tv technology  with a selection of primetime programmes being broadcast in the new format  which includes 5.1 digital surround sound.  but tv viewers in europe will have to wait to enjoy the eye-blasting high-definition images.  many high-end european tv programmes  such as the recent athens olympics  are already being produced in high-definition. but they still reach your screen in the old 625 lines. the prospects for getting sharper images soon do not seem very encouraging. according to consultants strategy analytics  only 12% of homes in europe will have tvs capable of showing programmes in high-definition by 2008. but the hdtv hype spilling out of the us and japan has spurred european broadcasters and consumer electronic companies to push for change. big sports and entertainment events are set to help trigger the general public s attention. the 2006 world cup in germany will be broadcast in high-definition.  in the uk  satellite broadcaster bskyb is planning hdtv services in 2006. there is already a hdtv service in europe called euro1080. other european broadcasters  especially in france and germany  also aiming to launch similar services.  in britain  digital satellite and cable are largely seen as the natural home for hdtv  at least while a decision is taken regarding terrestrial broadcast options. the communications watchdog ofcom could hand over some terrestrial frequencies freed up when the uk switches off its analogue tv signal. for now  broadcasters like the bbc are working on their own hdtv plans  although with no launch date in sight.  the bbc will start broadcasting in hdtv when the time is right  and it would not be just a showcase  but a whole set of programming   says andy quested  from the bbc s high-definition support group.  we have made the commitment to produce all our output in high-definition by 2010  which would put us on the leading edge.  one of the options under consideration is to offer high-definition pictures on the web. the bbc has already dipped its toe into this  including some hdtv content in recent trials of its interactive media player - a video player for pcs. it is planning to offer special releases of selected flagship programmes online in the near future. according to mr quested  this could help put europe back into the running in the race to switch to hdtv. this is backed by recent research which suggests that the number of europeans with broadband has exploded over the past 12 months  with the web eating into tv viewing habits.,4
business,car giant hit by mercedes slump a slump in profitability at luxury car maker mercedes has prompted a big drop in profits at parent daimlerchrysler.  the german-us carmaker saw fourth quarter operating profits fall to 785m euros ($1bn) from 2.4bn euros in 2003. mercedes-benz s woes - its profits slid to just 20m euros - obscured a strong performance from the chrysler group whose returns met market expectations. mercedes faces fierce competition in the luxury car sector from bmw and but hopes to revive its fortunes by 2006.  mercedes  profits over the period compared unfavourably with 2003 s 784m euro figure and were well below analyst expectations of 374m euros. for the year as a whole  its operating profits fell 46% to 1.6bn euros. sales of mercedes  brands fell 2% as demand cooled  while revenues were affected by the weakness of the us dollar.  the carmaker blamed the fall in profits on high launch costs for new models and losses from its mercedes smart mini-car range. mercedes is hoping to increase productivity by 3bn euros  having negotiated 500m euros in annual savings with german workers last year. the firm said it was determined to retain mercedes  position as the world s most successful luxury brand. however  daimlerchrysler s shares fell 1.5% on the news.  while all these divisions are doing well the big worries continue to surround mercedes-benz   michael rabb  an analyst with bank sal oppenheim  told reuters.  in contrast  chrysler enjoyed a 5% annual increase in unit sales while revenues - calculated in us dollars - rose 10%. the us division - whose marques include dodge and jeep - transformed a full year operating loss of 506m euros in 2003 into a 1.4bn euros profit last year.  overall  daimlerchrysler saw worldwide vehicle sales rise 8% to 4.7 million in 2004 while total revenues added 4% to 142bn euros. chrysler s strong performance helped the world s fifth largest carmaker boost net income by 400m euros to 2.5bn euros.   the year 2004 shows that our strategy works well - even in such a challenging competitive environment   said jurgen schrempp  daimlerchrysler s chairman. daimlerchrysler took a 475m euro hit in costs stemming from a defects scandal at its joint venture  japanese subsidiary fuso. daimlerchrysler last week agreed a compensation package with partner mitsubishi motors which will see it buy out its stake in fuso. looking forward  daimerchrysler s profits are expected to be slightly higher in 2005. however  it is expecting  significant improvements  in profitability in 2006 as a result of a major investment in the mercedes product range.,0
politics,falconer rebuts  charade  claims concessions on a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia  through the back door  were not a political ploy  the lord chancellor has said.  ministers have been accused of panic in offering last minute changes to the mental capacity bill amid chaotic scenes in the commons on tuesday. lord falconer said it was fair to criticise the late timing of the offer. he said the changes provided a solution to a very difficult issue but some mps argue the situation is still unclear.  the bill allows people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf if they become too ill to decide for themselves. ministers insist the plans would not change laws on euthanasia and would improve safeguards. critics fear it could allow  killing by omission  through withdrawing treatment  including food and fluids.  tony blair said he would do everything he could to meet concerns about the bill. but changes to the bill must not overturn the law set when a court ruled that doctors could withdraw artificial feeding and hydration from hillsborough coma victim tony bland.  it is important we don t end up in the situation where doctors and consultants are confused about the law and may lay themselves open to prosecution in circumstances where no sensible person would want that to happen   he said.  on tuesday  the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to the bill by 297 votes to 203  despite rebellion by 34 labour mps. the revolt was also reduced by news that lord falconer had promised the catholic archbishop of cardiff to strengthen safeguards in the bill. but that only came after mps bombarded constitutional affairs minister david lammy with a barrage of requests for him to read the letter as they complained they had been left in the dark. eventually  he was hurriedly handed the letter to read out five minutes before the crunch votes  prompting claims of a shambles. the deputy speaker later said the debate had not been handled as it should have been.  lord falconer says there will be amendments when the bill goes to the house of lords. he told bbc news:  we have given a commitment to put into the bill a clause that says that nothing in the bill authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life.  the motive has got to be to end suffering.  he denied the concessions were a  political manoeuvre  forced by panic about the rebellion. it was inevitable that minds became more focused as the bill went through parliament but the result was a  sensible solution   he said.  i don t think it is something to be embarrassed about. these issues are not easy to deal with   he went on. bbc political editor andrew marr said mr lammy was  waste deep in quicksand and sinking fast  after his performance. but lord falconer praised his minister for an  excellent job . former conservative leader iain duncan smith  one of the chief critics of the plans  condemned the debate as a  charade  and complained the promises of changes to the bill were vague.,2
tech,mobile tv tipped as one to watch scandinavians and koreans  two of the most adventurous groups of mobile users  are betting on mobile tv.  anders igels  chief executive of nordic operator teliasonera  tipped it as the next big thing in mobile in a speech at the 3gsm world congress  a mobile trade fair  in cannes this week. nokia  the finnish handset maker  is planning a party in singapore this spring to launch its tv to mobile activities in the region. consultancy strategy analytics of boston estimates that mobile broadcast networks will have acquired around 51 million users worldwide by 2009  producing around $6.6bn (Â£3.5bn) in revenue.  sk telecom of south korea  which is launching a tv to mobile service (via satellite) in may plans to charge a flat fee of $12 a month for its 12 channels of video and 12 channels of audio. it will be able to offer an additional two pay tv channels using conditional access technology. mr shin-bae kim  chief executive of sk telecom  also at 3gsm  said:  we have plans to integrate tv with mobile internet services.   this will enable viewers to access the mobile internet to get more information on adverts they see on tv.  there will be 12 handsets available for the launch of the korean service. lg electronics of south korea was demonstrating one at 3gsm that could display video at 30 frames a second. footage shown on the handset was clear and watchable. a speech on mobile tv by angel gambino of the bbc also drew a large crowd  suggesting that even those mobile operators and equipment vendors which are not particularly active in mobile tv yet are starting to look into it.  but all is not simple and straightforward in the mobile tv arena. there is a battle for supremacy between two competing standards: dvb-h for digital video broadcasting for handsets and dmb for digital multimedia broadcasting. dr chan yeob yeun  vice president and research fellow in charge of mobile tv at lg electronics  said:  dmb offers twice the number of frames a minute as dvb-h and does not drain mobile batteries as quickly.  the japanese  koreans and ericsson of sweden are backing dmb.  samsung of south korea has a dmb phone too that will be one of those offered to users of the tu media satellite mobile tv service to be launched in korea in may. nokia  by contrast  is backing dvb-h  and is involved in mobile tv trials that use its art-deco style media phone  which has a larger than usual screen for tv or visual radio (a way of accompanying a radio programme with related text and pictures). mobile operators o2 and vodafone are among the operators trialling mobile tv. but even if the standards battle is resolved  there is the thorny issue of broadcasting rights. ms gambino says the bbc now negotiates mobile rights when it is negotiating content.  for those not convinced mobile users will want to watch tv on their handsets  digital audio broadcasting may provide a good compromise and better sound quality than conventional radio. developments in this area are continuing. at a dab conference in cannes  several makers of dab chips for mobiles announced smaller  lower- cost chips which consume less power. among the chip companies present were frontier silicon and radioscape. the jury is still out on whether tv and digital radio on mobiles will make much money for anyone. but with many new services going live soon  it won t be long before the industry finds out.,4
sport,isinbayeva claims new world best pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva broke her own indoor world record by clearing 4.89 metres in lievin on saturday.  it was the russian s 12th world record of her career and came just a few days after she cleared 4.88m at the norwich union grand prix in birmingham. the olympic champion went on to attempt 5.05m at the meeting on france but failed to clear that height. in the men s 60m  former olympic 100m champion maurice greene could only finish second to leonard scott. it was greene s second consecutive defeat at the hands of his fellow american  who also won in birmingham last week.  i ran my race perfectly   said scott  who won in 6.46secs  his best time indoors.  i am happy even if i know that maurice is a long way from being at his peak at the start of the season.,3
sport,radcliffe proves doubters wrong this won t go down as one of the greatest marathons of paula s career. but as a test of character  it was the toughest race she s ever taken part in.  a win in the new york marathon doesn t make up for the disappointment of athens in any shape or form  but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year. if paula s last experience of the year had been athens  it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism. she can now draw a line under this year and make plans about her future. even if she d lost this race  there would have been a lot of positives to take out of it. she knows she can dig deep if she needs to. it was a strong field  with a number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning. and although two hours 23 minutes wasn t one of paula s best times  it wasn t far off the record on a difficult course.  i was speaking to paula in the lead-up to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing a no-win situation. she thought that if she won  people would say  why couldn t she do that in athens   and if she lost  people would say her career was over. and a lot of people were wondering what would happen if paula was forced to drop out of this race  as she did in the marathon and 10 000m in athens. but that was never on the cards. she might have been beaten  but she would have kept running. the reasons she was forced to pull out in athens - the niggling injuries  her lack of energy and the oppressive conditions - weren t at play here. the only question was what position she could finish in. most important of all  despite all the hype in the media ahead of this race  there were never doubts in paula s mind. if she wasn t confident  she wouldn t have run. after all  if you re the best in the world at an event  you ll always have expectations of winning.  now paula will take part in the run london 10km race in london at the end of the year  have a well-earned rest over christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism.,3
tech,fast lifts rise into record books two high-speed lifts at the world s tallest building have been officially recognised as the planet s fastest.  the lifts take only 30 seconds to whisk passengers to the top of the 508m tall tfc 101 tower in taipei  taiwan. the guinness book of records has declared the 17m per second speed of the two lifts the swiftest on earth. the lifts also have a pressure control system to stop passengers  ears popping as they ascend and descend at high speed.  in total  the tfc tower has 61 lifts  34 of them double-deckers  and 50 escalators to shuttle people around its 106 floors. the tfc 101 tower is due to be officially opened on 31 december.  the super-fast lifts can speed up to 24 passengers to the tip of the tower in about 30 seconds  while ascending their 382m track. the 17m/s top speed of the lifts translates to about 38mph (61km/h). curiously the lifts take longer to descend and spend almost a whole minute returning to ground level from the top of the tfc tower. the key new technologies applied in the world s fastest elevators include:    - a pressure control system  which adjusts the atmospheric pressure inside a car by using suction and discharge blowers  preventing  ear popping    - an active control system which tries to balance the lift more finely and remove the sources of vibrations   - streamlined cars to reduce the whistling noise produced by running the lifts at a high speed inside a narrow shaft      the certification of our elevators as world record-holders by the authoritative guinness world records is a great honour for us   said masayuki shimono  president of manufacturer toshiba elevator and building systems which installed the lifts. the first record for the world s fastest passenger elevators was published in the first edition of the guinness book of records in 1955.  as such  it is an interesting indicator of how technology has advanced in the 50 years since that first edition  when the record was 426m per minute  or 25.6 km/h  less than half the speed of the new record   said hein le roux  specialist researcher at the guinness world records. taipei s tfc 101 tower is more than 50m taller than the petronas towers in kuala lumpur  malaysia - formerly the world s tallest skyscraper.,4

entertainment,legendary music studio to close the new york music studio where john lennon spent his final hours is to close next month.  the hit factory  which opened 37 years ago  has played host to some of the biggest stars in music  including paul simon  madonna and david bowie. however  the rise in digital recording has affected business at the studio  which is relocating to smaller premises in miami. lennon recorded his final album double fantasy at the studio in 1979.  the studio was founded by jerry ragovoy in 1968. in 1975 it was sold to fellow producer edward germano  who turned it into a 100 000 square foot studio with seven recording rooms and live mastering suites. his first client was stevie wonder  who recorded part of his classic album songs in the key of life there. other well-known albums to be recorded or partially recorded at the studio include bruce springsteen s born in the usa  the rolling stones  emotional rescue and paul simon s graceland. michael jackson  billy joel  jay-z and beyonce are also among artists who have used the hit factory in the past  as well as 50 cent who survived an attempt on his life as he left the premises in 2000. the studio made history in 1994 when it won a record 41 grammy nominations for songs recorded  mastered or mixed there  including the soundtrack to the whitney houston film the bodyguard.,1
entertainment,actor scott is new bond favourite bookmaker william hill has stopped taking bets on who will be the next james bond  following a succession of large wagers on actor dougray scott.  the firm closed the book on friday  saying  insider information  could have contributed to the number of bets.  in the past gambles like this have often been right   william hill spokesman rupert adams said. the closing list gave scott odds of 6-9  followed by oscar nominee clive owen at 5-2. scott first found fame in the tv series soldier soldier and has since then starred in such films as mission impossible ii and the wartime drama enigma.  mr adams said one punter had placed a bet of Â£870 on the 39-year-old actor at odds of 8-1.  she told us she had some inside information  perhaps she knew he had been to a casting  but she wouldn t say   he said. others thought to be in the running include star wars actor ewan mcgregor and australian star hugh jackman  both of whom have odds of 4-1. colin farrell  jude law and troy star eric bana have also been tipped for the role in the past.  a large number of bets on actor colin salmon to become the first black james bond were dismissed as a publicity stunt a month ago. the next bond film  originally due for release in 2005  has been delayed until 2006 due to sony s takeover of the mgm studio. the most recent  die another day  was released in late 2002 and saw pierce brosnan make his final appearance as the secret agent. the actor was originally due to make a fifth appearance as bond  but was released from his contract in 2004.,1
politics,teens  know little  of politics teenagers questioned for a survey have shown little interest in politics - and have little knowledge.  only a quarter of 14-16 year olds knew that labour was the government  the tories were the official opposition and the lib dems were the third party. almost all could identify tony blair  but only one in six knew who michael howard was  and just one in 10 recognised charles kennedy. the icm survey interviewed 110 pupils for education watchdog ofsted. nearly half those pupils polled said it was not important for them to know more about what the political parties stand for. and 4% of those questioned thought the conservatives were in power - while 2% of them believed the lib dems were. the survey also looked at issues of nationality. it found the union flag and fish and chips topped the list of symbols and foods associated with being british. many of the pupils also looked on themselves as english  scottish or welsh  rather than british; while the notion of being european hardly occurred to anyone.,2
business,electrolux to export europe jobs electrolux saw its shares rise 14% on tuesday after it said it would be shifting more of its manufacturing to low-cost countries.  the swedish firm  the world s largest maker of home appliances  said it is to relocate about 10 of its 27 plants in western europe and north america. it did not say which facilities would be affected  but intends moving them to asia  eastern europe and mexico. the company has two manufacturing sites in county durham. it makes lawn and garden products in newton aycliffe  and cookers and ovens in spennymoor. the newton aycliffe plant could also be affected by electrolux s separate announcement that it is to spin-off its outdoor products unit into a new separate company.  electrolux s subsidiary brands include aeg  zanussi and frigidaire. the company said it was speeding up its restructuring programme  which aims to save between Â£190m and Â£265m annually from 2009.  we see that about half the plants in high-cost countries - that is around 10 - are at risk   said electrolux chief executive hans straberg.  it looks pretty grim   said swedish trades union official ulf carlsson.  what are we going to end up producing in sweden,0
politics,howard denies split over id cards michael howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial labour plans to introduce id cards.  the tory leader said his front bench team had reached a  collective view  after holding a  good discussion   but admitted it was  not an easy issue . he had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror  crime and illegal immigration. the lib dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next monday.  tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the id card scheme. among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members david davis  oliver letwin and tim yeo. but mr howard denied mr yeo  his transport and environment spokesman  said the plans  stink . he also said he was confident shadow home secretary mr davis would  set out the position very clearly  when he stands up to debate the matter next week. mr howard said the police had said id cards could  help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives . he added:  when the police say that you have to take them seriously .  he acknowledged there were  good libertarian arguments  against the cards  but said the shadow cabinet had weighed up all the  conflicting interests  before reaching its decision.  i don t pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken.  he also denied he was afraid of looking  soft  on the issue  compared to labour. the conservatives announced their support for the government plans on monday evening.  sources within the party told the bbc mr howard had always been in favour of id cards  and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. but the tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.  they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would be able to deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people s privacy would be properly protected.  it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect   a spokesman said. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten has branded the id scheme a waste of money and  deeply flawed . he said:  this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues  concerns over id cards.   the chairman of the bar council  guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the  margins of society  would be driven into the hands of extremists.  what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere  they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained.  tory ex-minister douglas hogg said he opposed the plans for id cards branding them a  regressive  step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. he predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of britain s ethnic minorities being stopped by police.,2
politics,new ukip defection to  veritas  the uk independence party has lost one of its two london assembly members to robert kilroy-silk s new political party  expected to launch on wednesday.  damian hockney said ex-chatshow host mr kilroy-silk would  deliver better  as the leader of a eurosceptic party. he said mr kilroy-silk had made him deputy party leader of veritas  latin for truth. sources close to mr hockney said around eight other members of london ukip were also planning to jump ship.  details of the coming week s events were hammered out at a meeting at mr kilroy-silk s buckinghamshire home on sunday  the bbc news website was told. the news came after ukip suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed. john houston  54  was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election. a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly. ukip asserts that mr hockney  has a moral obligation  if not a legal one  to stand down. mr hockney meanwhile told the bbc:  i believe that robert kilroy-silk can deliver better as a leader of a eurosceptic party than the current leadership of the uk independence party.   on the suspension of mr houston  ukip said those who selected him knew nothing of his views. mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be  made available to law-abiding members of the community  and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade.  the document reportedly said:  we re looking for the resurrection of the british empire.  the problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale  and that calls for a radical alliance of the english-speaking nations  which they are uniquely able to do.  ukip spokesman mark croucher said the main issue would be that mr houston s reported views had been presented as ukip policy  which they were not.,2
tech,viewers to be able to shape tv imagine editing titanic down to watch just your favourite bits or cutting out the slushier moments of star wars to leave you with a bare bones action-fest.  manipulating your favourite films to make a more personalised movie is just the beginning of an ambitious new 7.5m euro (Â£5.1m) project funded by the european union. new media for a new millennium (nm2) will have as its endgame the development of a completely new media genre  which will allow audiences to create their own media worlds based on their specific interests or tastes. viewers will be able to participate in storylines  manipulate plots and even the sets and props of tv shows. bt is one of 13 partners involved in the project. it will be contributing software that was originally designed to spot anomalies in cctv pictures. the software uses content recognition algorithms. the three-year project will work on seven productions as it develops a set of software tools that will allow viewers to edit content to their needs.  one of the productions will be a experimental television show where the plot will be driven by text messages from the tv audience.  participants will text selected words which will impact how the characters in the drama interact. it is being developed in finland and will be shown to finnish tv audiences. another team will work on the bbc s big budget drama of mervyn peake s gothic fantasy gormenghast. it will be re-engineered to allow people to choose a variety of edited versions.  the bbc is allowing us access to the material so that we can prove the technology and the principles   explained dr doug williams of bt  who will be nm2 s technical project manager.  the tv at the moment is a relatively dumb box which receives signals. this project is about teaching the machine to look at content like lego blocks that can be reassembled to make perfect sense   he said.  at the moment we have interactive gaming and a limited form of interactive tv which usually means allowing audiences to vote on shows. we are hoping to occupy the space in-between   he added.  nm2 s co-ordinator peter stollenmayer explained that the new genre would radically alter the role of the audience.   viewers will be able to interact directly with the medium and influence what they see and hear according to their personal tastes and wishes   he said.  media users will no longer be passive viewers but become active engagers.  it will also be important that the tools are sophisticated enough to obey the complex rules of cinematography and editing said john wyver  from tv producer illuminations television limited  which is also involved in the project.  it s not just a matter of stringing together the romantic or action portions of a production   said mr wyver.  the tool has to know which bits fit together both visually  by observing the time-honoured rules that go in editing  and in terms of the story.   only then will the personalised version both make sense and be aesthetically pleasing   he added. mr wyver is planning a production entitled the golden age  about renaissance art. it will allow viewers to create a so-called media world based on their own specific areas of interest such as poetry  music and architecture. other productions that the nm2 team will make range from news  documentaries to a romantic comedy drama.,4
sport,player burn-out worries robinson england coach andy robinson says english rugby has to act now to prevent injury destroying players  careers.  he will be without a host of big names for the six nations as the intensity of professional rugby union hits players.  injuries are part of the sport but we have to have a look at the amount of injuries that occur in the english season   robinson told bbc sport.  i think players are probably going to have three or four years taken off their careers.  robinson will be missing an entire midfield for the six nations with the likes of jonny wilkinson  mike tindall and will greenwood injured.  rugby union has become far more physically demanding since the game went professional nearly 10 years ago. as a result three of the major stakeholders in english rugby have launched an  injury audit  to find out how players are coping. the audit is jointly funded by the professional rugby players  association  the rugby football union and premier rugby. as far as robinson is concerned its findings must not be ignored.  i think there s an injury audit coming out in march that s got some great information in there that i think everybody in the english game has got to look at   he said.  if we don t the situation is going to get worse and not better  so i think rugby as a whole has got to look at this.,3
tech,latest opera browser gets vocal net browser opera 8.0  due for official release at the end of next month  will be  the most accessible browser on the market   according to its authors.  the latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. the voice features  based on ibm technology  are currently only available in the windows version. opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create  style sheets   its developers say. this will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. but the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people  so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision.  our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone   said opera spokeswoman  berit hanson.  so we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users.   another feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width  which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling.  the company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using opera with a handheld device. the company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people.  our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural   said ms hanson.  people are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard  so this makes the web a more hands-free experience.  unlike commercially available voice recognition software  opera does not have to be  trained  to recognise an individual voice. around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. the voice recognition function is currently only available in english. opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from norwegian telecoms company telenor. its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms.,4
business,ukraine revisits state sell-offs ukraine is preparing what could be a wholesale review of the privatisation of thousands of businesses by the previous administration.  the new president  viktor yushchenko  has said a  limited  list of companies is being drawn up. but on wednesday prime minister yulia tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise 3 000 firms. the government says many privatised firms were sold to allies of the last administration at rock-bottom prices. more than 90 000 businesses in all  from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts  have been sold off since 1992  as the command economy built up when ukraine was part of the soviet union was dismantled.  ms tymoshenko said prosecutors had drawn up a list of more than 3 000 businesses which were to be reviewed.  we will return to the state that which was illegally put into private hands.   a day earlier  mr yushchenko - keen to reassure potential investors - had said only 30 to 40 top firms would be targeted. the list  will be limited and final  and will not be extended after its completion   he said. an open-ended list could further damage outside investors  fragile faith in ukraine  said stuart hensel of the economist intelligence unit. but the government seemed keen not to make the review look like the kind of wholesale renationalisation which many fear in russia  mr hensel said. as a result  it was planning to resell rather than keep firms in state hands.  they re aware of the need not to scare investors  and to be careful of internal divides within ukraine   he said.  they don t want to be seen to be transferring assets from one set of oligarchs to a new set.  foreign investment in ukraine  at about $40 a head in 2004  is one of the lowest among ex-soviet states.  mr yushchenko became president after two elections in december  the first of which was annulled amid allegations of voting irregularities and massive street protests.  his opponent  viktor yanukovich  still has huge support in the country s eastern industrial heartland. mr yushchenko s administration has accused its predecessor  led by ex-president leonid kuchma  of corruption. the privatisation review s number one target is a steel mill sold to a consortium which included viktor pinchuk  mr kuchma s son-in-law  for $800m (Â£424m) despite higher bids from several foreign groups. the mill  krivorizhstal  is one of the world s most profitable.  we say krivorizhstal was stolen  and at any cost we will return it to the state   mr yushchenko told an investors  conference in kiev.  one of the jilted bidders  netherlands-based group lnm  said it welcomed the possibility that the mill might be back on the market.   if the original privatisation is annulled and a new tender issued  then we would look at it with great interest   a spokesman told bbc news. a resale of krivorizhstal could potentially triple the price  according to the economist intelligence unit s mr hensel. but he warned that the government could decide to take the easy route of revaluing the company and charging the existing owners the revised price rather than undertaking a fresh sale.  that way  mr yushchenko can go to the public and say he has forced the oligarchs to play by the rules   he told bbc news.,0
politics,what the election should really be about  a general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy. here is how six leading lobbies plan to make sure their cause is being debated ahead of an expected spring poll.  we ve called for the state pension to be increased from Â£79.60 to the pensioner credit guarantee level of Â£105.45. that s what we re calling for. many pensioners are disadvantaged by the current system. if we ve got one in five pensioners below the poverty line  we ve got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty.  we ve drawn up a pensioners  manifesto. this will be sent to each of the candidates in the 659 constituencies. they will be asked which of the top five issues  including the pension issue  they would support. once we ve got their responses we will publish the results within the constituencies and nationally as well. it s our way of putting the politicians on notice. we are trying to get across the fact that there are 11m voters over 60 in the country  they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters. before 1997 most pensioners voted conservative. in 1997 and 2001 they voted labour. but there is no guarantee they will vote for a labour government this time around. they cannot take that vote for granted.  pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of adair turner s full report into the issue. he said the uk had one of the least generous pensions systems in the developed world.  that the government takes seriously the impact of aviation on the environment.  we haven t worked out specific plans but i imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent mps. various local groups will do that in their particular areas and we will provide a national briefing. we don t have any large demonstrations planned but they can t be ruled out.  it is hard to say whether we will be successful. we have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent  but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like iraq.  repealing the hunting bill.  we are challenging the use of the parliament act 1949 in a high court action. we are hoping to hear in the new year. whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time. when the ban comes into force on 18 february we will be going to the european court because no compensation is being paid. so there s a lot of legal territory to go. we are trying to engage with the ministers by demonstrating and talking. whatever intelligence we get we will try to turn up and speak to whoever it is. (rural affairs minister) alun michael has avoided us and cancelled engagements so that makes it difficult. it is not intimidatory - on the whole it is groups of angry housewives. of course there is an element of shouting because people are angry but there is no violence because that does not achieve anything.  it will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election tony blair will ever face. it s exactly what the prime minister did not want. he wanted the issue off the table until after the election.  people using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad. the reason for including abroad is because of trophy hunting. it is another sort of form of shooting for sport. the principle is the same whether it s a tiger or a pheasant.  we will widely publicise what s happening in relation to trophy hunting. we will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the uk. we will seek to get pledges from individual mps and would-be mps saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports. we would like the support of political parties but i think a general election is very much to do with pledges mps make to their electors. with hunting we had many mps who were happy to say they were against it.  i think what we will get is a very real climbing up the agenda. whether or not we will get a ban i am not sure. but it will mobilise public opinion. everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a ban.  the issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice. the language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum. choice as an ideology is beginning to be the privatisation of this decade. it s become an issue in itself but what s really missing from the debate is the consumer s choice in that. choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools. we have seen so many pensions mis-selling scandals and in the pensions industry there s a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that. we want choice on the consumer s terms - that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice.  firstly  we have our website. it features our campaigns and changes every day. secondly through our 700 000 members who communicate with us. thirdly through the media and also what we will be doing is holding a pre-election conference. we will invite the opinion formers  mps  journalists and others. the idea is that we open up communications between members of the public and the politicians.  i think we will be successful. it s very much the language being used by the main political parties. politicians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issue.  fuel duty is a large part of operational costs for road haulage workers. we have been hearing about this proposed increase of 1.92p per litre that gordon brown has been postponing and postponing. tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle that s an increase of about Â£750. if you re running 10 vehicles it s obviously 10 times that.  if fuel duty does rise we will be absolutely horrified. there will be a huge effect throughout the industry and i would not be surprised if you see widespread demonstrations. what it will mean is there will be a number of firms going out of business.  we will continue to do what we have always done we keep the issue in the trade press. regrettably it s one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national press. whatever we do  the public don t like lorries - they see us as a complaining minority. but they don t realise that when you see a car on the road it is probably going to work  when you see a lorry it s already at work.,2
politics,tories urge  change at the top  tory delegates are gathering for what is expected to be their last conference before the general election  declaring britain needs  a change at the top .  the party goes into its spring forum trying to highlight what it sees as a clear choice between it and labour. tory co-chairman liam fox has opened proceedings with a speech criticising tony blair s record in government. labour s rule has been characterised by  lost trust and failure to deliver   he told the brighton conference. he also attacked the government s  failure  to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the nhs  telling delegates labour cannot be trusted on education or crime. a tory government would sort out the  shambles  of immigration  put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools  he said. dr fox also underlined tory promises to cut tax by Â£4bn.  bbc political correspondent shaun ley says opinion polls suggest the tories still lag some way behind labour on the issues of health  education and the economy. conservative leader michael howard  who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on friday  will address them in a lunchtime speech. his welcome address had to be postponed after he stayed in london to lead the party s opposition to the prevention of terrorism bill in its lengthy progress through parliament. the bill was finally passed on friday evening  after more than 30 hours of debate. mr howard is likely to defend his party s handling of the bill  which was only passed after the conservatives accepted prime minister tony blair s promise that mps would be able to review it within a year.,2
tech,hi-tech posters guide commuters interactive posters are helping londoners get around the city during the festive season.  when interrogated with a mobile phone  the posters pass on a number that people can call to get information about the safest route home. sited at busy underground stations  the posters are fitted with an infra-red port that can beam information directly to a handset. the posters are part of transport for london s safe travel at night campaign.  the campaign is intended to help londoners  especially women  avoid trouble on the way home. in particular it aims to cut the number of sexual assaults by drivers of unlicensed minicabs. nigel marson  head of group marketing at transport for london (tfl)  said the posters were useful because they work outside the mobile phone networks.  they can work in previously inaccessible areas such as underground stations which is obviously a huge advantage in a campaign of this sort   he said.  the posters will automatically beam information to any phone equipped with an ir port that is held close to the glowing red icon on the poster.  we started with infra-red because there are a huge number ir phones out there   said rachel harker  spokeswoman for hypertag which makes the technology fitted to the posters.  it s a well established technology.  hypertag is also now making a poster that uses short-range bluetooth radio technology to swap data. although the hypertags in the posters only pass on a phone number  ms harker said they can pass on almost any form of data including images  ring tones and video clips. she said that there are no figures for how many people are using the posters but a previous campaign run for a cosmetics firm racked up 12 500 interactions.  before we ran a campaign there was a big question mark of:  if we build it will they come    she said.  now we know that  yes  they will.  the tfl campaign using the posters will run until boxing day.,4

politics,blair  pressing us on climate  tony blair is pressing the us to cut greenhouse gases despite its unwillingness to sign the kyoto protocol  downing street has indicated.  officials have confirmed climate change was discussed when influential senator john mccain recently visited mr blair. climate change was an issue the prime minister  wanted to progress  during the uk s presidency of the g8 and eu in 2005  said a spokesman. but he played down reports mr blair was considering a new us-friendly treaty.  according to the times  the uk leader wants to end us isolation with a  kyoto-lite  agreement on the scale and nature of the threat from climate change. he is said to have discussed the idea with mr mccain during his time at number 10. the prime minister is said to believe the united states  refusal to sign the kyoto protocol on emissions is undermining other countries  resolve to cut carbon dioxide production. so far the us has refused to sign up to the kyoto treaty - which aims to cut emissions - branding it politically motivated and not based on science. president bush s advisers have repeatedly denied global warming is taking place.  europe  which disputes the claim  has also signalled it wants to press ahead with talks about longer term climate change action in a way which involves both the united states and developing countries. mr blair s reported treaty would also establish an international programme to develop technology needed for renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions  says the times. but there is still apparently  little prospect  of america agreeing to cut emissions  which could further provoke environmental campaigners already angry at the lack of progress. mr blair was left blushing on wednesday when it emerged his manifesto target of a 20% cut to the 1990 greenhouse gas level by 2010 was set to be missed.,2
business,bargain calls widen softbank loss japanese communications firm softbank has widened losses after heavy spending on a new cut-rate phone service.  the service  launched in december and dubbed  otoku  or  bargain   has had almost 900 000 orders  softbank said. the firm  a market leader in high-speed internet  had an operating loss for the three months to december of 7.5bn yen ($71.5m; Â£38.4m). but without the otoku marketing spend it would have made a profit - and expects to move into the black in 2006. the firm did not give a figure for the extent of profits it expected to make next year. it was born in the 1990s tech boom  investing widely and becoming a fast-rising star  till the end of the tech bubble hit it hard. its recent return to a high profile came with the purchase of japan telecom  the country s third-biggest fixed-line telecoms firm. the acquisition spurred its broadband internet division to pole position in the japanese market  with more than 5.1 million subscribers at the end of december.,0
politics,uk  needs true immigration data  a former home office minister has called for an independent body to be set up to monitor uk immigration.  barbara roche said an organisation should monitor and publish figures and be independent of government. she said this would counter  so-called independent  groups like migration watch  which she described as an anti-immigration body posing as independent. migration watch says it is not against all immigration and the government already publishes accurate figures. sir andrew green  chairman of the organisation  says there is no need for an independent body because office of national statistics data are accurate. he says he opposes large-scale immigration  both on the grounds of overcrowding and culture .  he said:  for example  over the next 20 years one household in three will be due to immigration.  we are already more overcrowded than india and we are four times more overcrowded than france.  ms roche  labour mp for hornsey and wood green  believes legal migration is something we should welcome. she said her proposals mean  we wouldn t have so-called independent experts  like migration watch  who come into this debate from an anti-immigration point of view.  she went on:  what i would like to see is there being a body which actually looked at the figures  published them  and was independent of government.  i think that would go a long way to allaying some of the fears that are sometimes whipped up during this debate.,2
business,consumer spending lifts us growth us economic growth accelerated in the third quarter  helped by strong consumer spending  official figures have shown.  the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.7% in the july to september period  the commerce department said. the figure marked an increase on the 3.3% growth recorded in the second quarter  but fell short of the 4.2% rate pencilled in by forecasters. the increase reflected the biggest jump in consumer spending in a year.  it was a little softer than the consensus  but not a real surprise   said gary thayer  an economist at ag edwards & sons. friday s growth estimate is one of the last significant pieces of economic data before the 2 november presidential election.  democrat challenger john kerry has criticised president george w bush s handling of the economy  pointing to a net loss of over 800 000 jobs since mr bush took office. analysts said the economy was still not growing fast enough to stimulate large-scale job creation.  it s a pretty good growth rate  but it may not be good enough to create enough jobs   said robert brusca  chief economist at fact and opinion economics in new york. however  president bush is expected to point to commerce department figures showing that consumer spending grew at 4.6% in the third quarter  up from just 1.6% in the second  as evidence that his policies are generating solid growth. consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic activity in the us.  the weaker than expected growth figure makes it less likely that the us federal reserve will raise interest rates next month  economists said.  the economy regained some traction in the third quarter  but the growth is not robust   ag edwards  thayer.  i think that means the fed can take its time raising rates. we ll probably see one more rate hike before the end of the year.  in an effort to pre-empt rising inflation  the federal reserve has pushed through three quarter-point rate rises since june this year  taking borrowing costs to 1.75%. on the financial markets  the dollar fell slightly against the euro and the yen  while the dow jones index of leading us shares was little changed.,0
sport,fit-again betsen in france squad france have brought flanker serge betsen back into their squad to face england at twickenham on sunday.  but the player  who missed the victory over scotland through injury  must attend a disciplinary hearing on wednesday after being cited by wasps.  serge has a good case so we are confident he will play   said france coach bernard laporte. the inexperienced nicolas mas  jimmy marlu and jean-philippe grandclaude are also included in a 22-man squad. the trio have been called up after pieter de villiers  ludovic valbon and aurelien rougerie all picked up injuries in france s 16-9 win on saturday.  laporte said he was confident that betsen would be cleared by the panel investigating his alleged trip that broke wasps centre stuart abbott s leg.  if he was to be suspended  we would call up imanol harinordoquy or thomas lievremont   said laporte  who has dropped patrick tabacco.  we missed serge badly against scotland. he has now recovered from his thigh injury and played on saturday with biarritz.  france s regular back-row combination of betsen  harinordoquy and olivier magne were all missing from france s side at the weekend because of injury. laporte is expected to announce france s starting line-up on wednesday.  forwards: nicolas mas  sylvain marconnet  olivier milloud  william servat  sebastien bruno  fabien pelous  jerome thion  gregory lamboley  serge betsen  julien bonnaire  sebastien chabal  yannick nyanga. backs: dimitri yachvili  pierre mignoni  frederic michalak  yann delaigue  damien traille  brian liebenberg  jean-philippe grandclaude  christophe dominici  jimmy marlu  pepito elhorga.,3
sport,corry backs skipper robinson england forward martin corry says jason robinson is the right man to lead the national team back to winning ways.  after losses to wales and france  critics have started to wonder whether robinson can captain from full-back. but corry has backed robinson  who was given the role after the injury to fly-half jonny wilkinson  ahead of this weekend s trip to ireland.  jason is doing a tremendous job. every week my respect for him goes up   corry told bbc radio five live.  he is an inspirational captain. when he talks with the squad he talks with a lot of sense.  the players have a lot of respect for him. it s an honour to be in the england side and an honour to play under him.   england are under immense pressure following their poor start to the year and victory is vital if they are to rescue their six nations campaign. but corry insists england are in the right frame of mind for the contest.  there is apprehension going into every game   he added.  but you have to use that fear and put it into a positive mindset.  when the whistle goes on sunday  what has happened in the past does not count for anything.   we have not performed but if we put in a performance on sunday then we can start turning results around.  there are a lot of changes taking place with england and we are at the start of something. we have not got off to the greatest of starts but you need to experience the bad the before you can fully appreciate the good.   a trip to lansdowne road is daunting at any time  especially against an ireland side that are flying high after two impressive wins. they are the form team of the tournament and are tipped to claim their first grand slam since 1948. but corry is relishing the prospect of taking on the irish in their own backyard.  they are full of confidence and are playing a great team game   he said.  the forwards are creating a great platform and they have explosive runners out wide.  if you look at the team on paper  they have stars from one to 15. it s a huge task but it is a great opportunity for us.  lansdowne road is a tremendous venue to play in and we have to use it to our advantage.,3
tech,blog reading explodes in america americans are becoming avid blog readers  with 32 million getting hooked in 2004  according to new research.  the survey  conducted by the pew internet and american life project  showed that blog readership has shot up by 58% in the last year. some of this growth is attributable to political blogs written and read during the us presidential campaign. despite the explosive growth  more than 60% of online americans have still never heard of blogs  the survey found. blogs  or web logs  are online spaces in which people can publish their thoughts  opinions or spread news events in their own words. companies such as google and microsoft provide users with the tools to publish their own blogs.  the rise of blogs has spawned a new desire for immediate news and information  with six million americans now using rss aggregators. rss aggregators are downloaded to pcs and are programmed to subscribe to feeds from blogs  news sites and other websites. the aggregators automatically compile the latest information published online from the blogs or news sites. reading blogs remains far more popular than writing them  the survey found. only 7% of the 120 million us adults who use the internet had created a blog or web-based diary. getting involved is becoming more popular though  with 12% saying they had posted material or comments on other people s blogs.  just under one in 10 of the us s internet users read political blogs such as the daily kos or instapundit during the us presidential campaign. kerry voters were slightly more likely to read them than bush voters. blog creators were likely to be young  well-educated  net-savvy males with good incomes and college educations  the survey found. this was also true of the average blog reader  although the survey found there was a greater than average growth in blog readership among women and those in minorities. the survey was conducted during november and involved telephone surveys of 1 324 internet users.,4
politics,green fear for transport ballot the green party is concerned thousands of residents may not be able to vote in edinburgh s transport referendum.  edinburgh city council is to ballot constituents on proposals to introduce congestion charging in the capital. but green msp mark ballard fears people not on the council s edited electoral register may miss out. local authorities can only send ballot papers to those on the edited list over non-statutory matters  such as the transport referendum. therefore  residents who have exercised their right to have their details left off the list could miss the chance to vote.  however  there is still time for those who are not on the list to contact the council and make sure they are sent ballot forms ahead of february s voting deadline. mr ballard said:  this vote will set the future of transport in edinburgh for decades to come.  it is therefore vital that as many residents as possible in edinburgh city and the surrounding areas  are registered to vote in the ballot.  many people are not aware that they may miss out on their chance to have a say.  everyone involved in this debate - both for and against - wants the ballot to be as fair and representative as possible  and that means encouraging people to take part.  the ballot will ask residents to vote for or against the council s proposed congestion charge scheme and a host of transport improvements to be funded by it. the outcome of the referendum will be known next month after the ballot forms are sent out and returned to the council. towards the end of february  the council will meet to decide whether to proceed with an application to scottish ministers for approval for its planned congestion charging scheme and the other parts of its transport package.,2

business,cars pull down us retail figures us retail sales fell 0.3% in january  the biggest monthly decline since last august  driven down by a heavy fall in car sales.  the 3.3% fall in car sales had been expected  coming after december s 4% rise in car sales  fuelled by generous pre-christmas special offers. excluding the car sector  us retail sales were up 0.6% in january  twice what some analysts had been expecting. us retail spending is expected to rise in 2005  but not as quickly as in 2004.  steve gallagher  us chief economist at sg corporate & investment banking  said january s figures were  decent numbers .   we are not seeing the numbers that we saw in the second half of 2004  but they are still pretty healthy   he added. sales at appliance and electronic stores were down 0.6% in january  while sales at hardware stores dropped by 0.3% and furniture store sales dipped 0.1%. sales at clothing and clothing accessory stores jumped 1.8%  while sales at general merchandise stores  a category that includes department stores  rose by 0.9%. these strong gains were in part put down to consumers spending gift vouchers they had been given for christmas.  sales at restaurants  bars and coffee houses rose by 0.3%  while grocery store sales were up 0.5%. in december  overall retail sales rose by 1.1%. excluding the car sector  sales rose by just 0.3%. parul jain  deputy chief economist at nomura securities international  said consumer spending would continue to rise in 2005  only at a slower rate of growth than in 2004.  consumers continue to retain their strength in the first quarter   he said. van rourke  a bond strategist at popular securities  agreed that the latest retail sales figures were  slightly stronger than expected .,0
politics,blair returns from peace mission prime minister tony blair has arrived back from his diplomatic mission to the middle east to try to resurrect the peace process.  mr blair held talks with his israeli counterpart  ariel sharon  and the palestinian leader  mahmoud abbas. he confirmed that a renewed drive to reform the palestinian authority and address security issues would come at a london conference in march. mr blair also made a surprise trip to iraq this week. the israelis described the meeting as important but said they would not need to attend. mr blair briefly visited the tomb of yasser arafat in ramallah - the first world leader to do so. he nodded briefly towards the tomb  rather than lay a wreath  in what palestinian officials said was a compromise gesture agreed at the last minute.  the bbc s paul reynolds says the london conference will be a limited measure to shore up the leadership of mahmoud abbas  also known as abu mazen  who is expected to win the palestinian presidential election on 9 january. at a news conference following talks with mr blair  mr abbas said the british prime minister was  in a unique position to help us progress in our peaceful pursuit . he added:  your endeavour to hold a conference in london is another example of your deep commitment to this purpose.  in an interview with the bbc s political editor andrew marr  mr blair said getting progress between israelis and palestinians would be  tough  but at least we have got the first step . mr blair acknowledged some people believed he was too close to the israelis  but said the israelis were entitled to expect palestinians to give up terrorism. he argued that mr sharon was committed to the internationally-agreed roadmap peace plan and said his bid to disengage from gaza had to be part of the peace process  not the end of it. earlier  mr sharon again said he had not seen  the slightest step  the palestinians were working to end terror attacks - though he acknowledged palestinian leaders were in the middle of an election campaign that could be hampering their efforts. before visiting israel  mr blair made a surprise visit to iraq  where he met leaders in baghdad during his first trip to the city. he was briefed on preparations for the national poll  which is scheduled for next month but is threatened by a deadly campaign of insurgent violence. he also flew to basra in southern iraq where british forces are stationed.,2

tech,games win for blu-ray dvd format the next-generation dvd format blu-ray is winning more supporters than its rival  according to its backers.  blu-ray  backed by 100 firms including sony  is competing against toshiba and nec-backed hd-dvd to be the format of choice for future films and games. the blu-ray association said on thursday that games giants electronic arts and vivendi would both support its dvd format. the next generation of dvds will hold high-definition video and sound. this offers incredible 3d-like quality of pictures which major hollywood studios and games publishers are extremely keen to exploit in the coming year. in a separate press conference at the consumer electronics show in las vegas  toshiba announced that dvd players for its technology would be on the market by the end of 2005.   as we move from standard definition video images to high-definition images  we have a much greater need for storage   richard doherty  from panasonic s hollywood laboratories  one of the pioneers of blu-ray  told the bbc news website.  so by utilising blue laser-based technology we can make an optical laser disc that can hold six times as much as today s dvd.  a blu-ray disc will be able to store 50gb of high-quality data  while toshiba s hd-dvd will hold 30gb. mr doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all high-definition needs  including the ability to record onto the dvds and smaller discs to fit into camcorders. both toshiba and blu-ray are hopeful that the emerging dvd format war  akin to the betamax and vhs fight in the 1980s  can be resolved over the next year when next-generation dvd players start to come out. when players do come out  they will be able to play standard dvds too  which is good news for those who have huge libraries of current dvds.  but the support from vivendi and electronics arts is a big boost to blu-ray in the battle for supremacy.  gaming is a $20 billion industry worldwide  so is as crucial as the film industry in terms of money to be made.  the technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced optical-disc technologies   said michael heilmann  chief technology officer for vivendi universal.  blu-ray offers the capacity  performance and high-speed internet connectivity to take us into the future of gaming.  ea  a leading games developer and publisher  added that the delivery of high-definition games of the future was vital and blu-ray had the capacity  functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning. sony recently announced it would be using the technology in its next generation of playstations. mr doherty said gamers were  ravenous  for high-quality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles.  gamers  especially those working on pcs  are always focused on more capacity to deliver textures  deeper levels  for delivering higher-resolution playback.   he added:  the focus for games moving forward is on increased immersion.   gaming companies really like to focus on creating a world which involves creating complicated 3d models and textures and increasing the resolution  increasing the frame rate - all of these are part of getting a more immersive experience.  fitting these models on current dvd technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost. as games move to more photo-real capability  the current technology is limiting.  they are thrilled at the advanced capacity to start to build these immersive environments   said mr doherty. currently  graphics-intensive pc games also require multiple discs for installation. high-definition dvds will cut down on that need. likewise  consoles rely on single discs  so dvds that can hold six times more data mean much better  high-resolution games. blu-ray has already won backing from major hollywood studios  such as mgm studios  disney  and buena vista  as well as top technology firms like dell  lg  samsung and phillips amongst others. while toshiba s hd-dvd technology has won backing from paramount  universal and warner bros.  the real world benefits (of hd-dvd) are apparent and obvious   said jim cardwell  president of warner home video. mr cardwell added that rapid time to market and dependability were significant factors in choosing to go with hd-dvd. both formats are courting microsoft to be the format of choice for the next generation xbox  but discussions are still on-going. next generation dvds will also be able to store images and other data. ces is the largest consumer electronics show in the world  and runs from 6 to 9 january.,4
sport,man utd stroll to cup win wayne rooney made a winning return to everton as manchester united cruised into the fa cup quarter-finals.  rooney received a hostile reception  but goals in each half from quinton fortune and cristiano ronaldo silenced the jeers at goodison park. fortune headed home after 23 minutes before ronaldo scored when nigel martyn parried paul scholes  free-kick. marcus bent missed everton s best chance when roy carroll  who was later struck by a missile  saved at his feet.  rooney s return was always going to be a potential flashpoint  and he was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kick-off. and rooney s every touch was met with a deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the 19-year-old. everton started brightly and fortune needed to be alert to scramble away a header from bent near the goal-line. but that was the cue for united to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a goodison park pitch that was cutting up. fortune gave united the lead after 23 minutes  rising to meet ronaldo s cross from eight yards after the portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless gary naysmith. united dominated without creating too many clear-cut chances  and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before half-time. mikel arteta played a superb ball into the area but bent  played onside by gabriel heintze  hesitated and carroll plunged at his fee to save. united almost doubled their lead after 48 minutes when ronaldo s low drive from 25 yards took a deflection off tony hibbert  but martyn dived to save brilliantly. and martyn came to everton s rescue three minutes later when rooney s big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through  but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form. but there was nothing martyn could do when united doubled their lead after 57 minutes as they doubled their advantage. scholes  free-kick took a deflection  and martyn could only parry the ball out for ronaldo  who reacted first to score easily. everton s problems worsened when james mcfadden limped off with an injury. and there may be further trouble ahead for everton after goalkeeper carroll required treatment after he was struck on the head by a missile thrown from behind the goal. rooney s desperate search for a goal on his return to everton was halted again by martyn in injury-time when he outpaced stubbs  but once again martyn denied the england striker.  - manchester united coach sir alex ferguson:  it was a fantastic performance by us. in fairness i think everton have missed a couple of players and got some young players out.  the boy ronaldo is a fantastic player. he s persistent and never gives in.  i don t know how many fouls he had he gets up and wants the ball again  he s truly a fabulous player.  everton: martyn  hibbert  yobo  stubbs  naysmith  osman  carsley  arteta  kilbane  mcfadden  bent. subs: wright  pistone  weir  plessis  vaughan. manchester united: carroll  gary neville  brown  ferdinand  heinze  ronaldo  phil neville  keane  scholes  fortune  rooney. subs: howard  giggs  smith  miller  spector. referee: r styles (hampshire),3
tech,pc photo printers challenge pros home printed pictures can be cheaper and higher quality than those from high street developers  tests shows.  a survey carried out by pc pro magazine looked at which of 100 home photo printers offered a better deal than handing your snaps to a photo lab. the tests found that images from top pc printers kept their colour longer than professionally produced photographs. but using the wrong printer cartridge could means snaps fade in months  warned the magazine.  the group test of 100 home photo printers for pcs discovered how much it costs to create images using the devices compared to online developers as well as high street names such as jessops  boots and snappy snaps. the comprehensive test also revealed how quickly different printers produced images  the quality of the finished image and how resistant finished pictures were to smudging or water damage. it found that although some ink for printers now costs more than Â£2 per millilitre it can still be cheaper to produce prints from photographs at home than it is to send them off to a high street store.  if you really like your photos  then it s definitely worth printing at home instead of going to the high street  but only if you choose the right printer   said nick ross  top tester at pc pro.  mr ross said that a new generation of printers produced images with brighter colours and that were less likely to fade than many high street developers or even some professional wedding photographers. some high street photo shops can be the cheapest when it came to developing prints that were 6x4in  said mr ross  but the test revealed that images 7x5in and 8x10in in size were cheaper to produce at home. according to pc pro  producing a print 8x10in on an epson r800 printer using top quality paper costs Â£1.87. at jessops the same image would cost Â£2.50 and at snappy snaps Â£9.99. a 10x7in snap at boots would cost Â£4.99.  considering how inconvenient it can be to go to the high street and how silver-halide prints can fade in the sun  we re adamant that it s now better  cheaper and more convenient to print at home   he said. ann simpson  marketing manager at snappy snaps believes the convenience of high street printing will continue to attract customers.  some people will want to do their own thing on their computer but the feedback to us is that customers often have to print two or three pictures at home in order to get a good one   she said.  many people are not skilled at getting the colour  contrast and cropping right and they don t want the hassle   she added. the magazine test found that which ink consumers use determined how long their prints lasted before they started fading. it recommended avoiding so-called third-party inks not produced by printer makers because they tended to produce prints that fade the quickest.,4

business,china now top trader with japan china overtook the us to become japan s biggest trading partner in 2004  according to numbers released by japan s finance ministry on wednesday.  china accounted for 20.1% of japan s trade in 2004  compared with 18.6% for the us. in 2003  the us was ahead with 20.5% and china came second with 19.2%. the change highlights china s growing importance as an economic powerhouse. in 2004  japan s imports from and exports to china (and hong kong) added up to 22 201bn yen ($214.6bn;Â£114.5bn). this is the highest figure for japanese trade with china since records began in 1947. it compares with 20 479.5bn yen in trade with the us.  trade with the us during 2004 was hurt by one-off factors  including a 13-month ban on us beef imports following the discovery of a cow infected with mad cow disease (bse) in the us. however  economists predict china will become an even more important japanese trading partner in the coming years. on tuesday  figures showed china s economy grew by 9.5% in 2004 and experts say the overall growth picture remains strong. analysts see two spurs to future growth as being china s membership of the world trade organisation and lower trade tariffs. during 2004  japan s trade surplus grew 17.9% to 12.011 trillion yen  with more than half the surplus  6.962 trillion yen  accounted for by its trade with the us. in december  the surplus grew 1.8% on a year ago to 1.14 trillion yen thanks to stronger-than-expected exports.,0
tech,tough rules for ringtone sellers firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all uk phone networks.  the rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services. the first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work. the rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones.  in the last couple of years ringtones  wallpapers  screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular. but fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers  said jeremy flynn  head of third party services at vodafone.   if you are not on the operator s portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it s a problem of how people discover your services   he said. to combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers. this tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them  for instance  several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting. mr flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of 2004. websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for.  what made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently   said mr flynn.  people did not know they were being offered a subscription service.   we saw potential for substantial consumer harm here   he added.  the swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones. the drafting of the new rules was led by the mobile entertainment forum and the uk s phone firms.  everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct   said andrew bud  regulatory head of the mef and executive chairman of messaging firm mblox.   it s all about transparency   he said.  consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it.   the consumer has a right to be protected   he said. christian harris  partnership manager of mobile content firm zed  said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads.  the groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that s done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out   he said. the new rules came in to force on 15 january and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them. some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for  said mr flynn. also  said mr flynn  vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules.  we have quite draconian contracts with firms   he said.  we do not have to say why. we can just cut them off.  under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal  stop  command sent via text message. he said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service.  the mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality   said mr flynn.,4

business,weak end-of-year sales hit next next has said its annual profit will be Â£5m lower than previously expected because its end-of-year clearance sale has proved disappointing.   clearance rates in our end-of-season sale have been below our expectations   the company said. the high street retailer said it now expected to report annual profits of between Â£415m and Â£425m ($779m-798m). next s shares fell more than 3% following the release of the trading statement.  next chief executive simon wolfson admitted that festive sales were  below where we would expect a normal christmas to be   but said sales should still top analyst expectations.  among areas where next could have done better  mr wolfson said menswear ranges were  a little bit too similar to the previous year . mr wolfson also said that disappointing pre-christmas sales were  more to do with the fact that we went in with too much stock rather than (the fact that) demand wasn t there for the stock . next s like-for-like store sales in the five months from 3 august to 24 december were up 2.9% on a year earlier. this figure is for existing next stores  which were unaffected by new next store openings. like-for-like sales growth at the 49 next stores directly affected by new store openings in their locality was 0.5%.  overall sales across both its retail and mail order divisions were up 12.4%  next said. its next directory mail order division saw sales rise 13.4% during the five-month period.  in terms of all the worries about their trading pre-christmas  it s a result   said nick bubb  an analyst at evolution securities.  profits of around Â£420m would be well within the comfort zone.  however  one dealer  who asked not to be named  told reuters the seasonal sales performance was  not what people had hoped for .  christmas has been tough for the whole sector  and this is one of the best retailers   he said. next s trading statement comes a day after house of fraser and woolworths disappointed investors with their figures.,0
tech,apple ipod family expands market apple has expanded its ipod family with the release of its next generation of the digital music players.  its latest challenges to the growing digital music gadget market include an ipod mini model which can hold 6gb compared to a previous 4gb. the company  which hopes to keep its dominant place in the digital music market  also said the gold coloured version of the mini would be dropped. a 30gb version has also been added to the ipod photo family. the latest models have a longer battery life and their prices have been cut by an average of Â£40. the original ipod took an early lead in the digital music player market thanks to its large storage capacity and simple design.  during 2004 about 25 million portable players were sold  10 million of which were apple ipods. but analysts agree that the success is also down to its integration with the itunes online store  which has given the company a 70% share of the legal download music market. mike mcguire  a research director at analyst gartner  told the bbc news website that apple had done a good job in  sealing off the market from competition  so far.  they have created a very seamless package which i think is the idea of the product - the design  function and the software are very impressive   he said. he added that the threat from others was always present  however.  creative  other microsoft-partnered devices  real  sony and so on  are ratcheting up the marketing message and advertising   he said. creative was very upbeat about how many of its creative zen players it had shipped by the end of last year  he said. its second-generation models  like the creative zen micro photo  is due out in the summer. it will have 5gb of memory on board.  digital music players are now the gadget of choice among young americans  according to recent research by the pew internet and american life project. one in 10 us adults - 22 million people - now owns a digital music player of some sort. sales of legally downloaded songs also rose more than tenfold in 2004  according to the record industry  with 200 million tracks bought online in the us and europe in 12 months. the ifpi industry body said that the popularity of portable music players was behind the growth. analysts say that the ease of use and growth of music services available on the net will continue to drive the trend towards portable music players.  people are also starting to use them in novel ways. some are combining automatic syncing functions many of them have with other net functions to automatically distribute diy radio shows  called podcasts. but 2005 will also see more competition from mobile phone operators who are keen to offer streaming services on much more powerful and sophisticated handsets. according to mr mcguire  research suggests that people like the idea of building up huge libraries of music  which they can do with high-capacity storage devices  like ipods and creative zens. mobiles do not yet have this capacity though  and there are issues about the ease of portability of mobile music. mr mcguire said apple was ensuring it kept a foot in the mobile music door with its recent deal with motorola to produce a version of itunes for motorola phones.,4
tech,games win for blu-ray dvd format the next-generation dvd format blu-ray is winning more supporters than its rival  according to its backers.  blu-ray  backed by 100 firms including sony  is competing against toshiba and nec-backed hd-dvd to be the format of choice for future films and games. the blu-ray association said on thursday that games giants electronic arts and vivendi would both support its dvd format. the next generation of dvds will hold high-definition video and sound. this offers incredible 3d-like quality of pictures which major hollywood studios and games publishers are extremely keen to exploit in the coming year. in a separate press conference at the consumer electronics show in las vegas  toshiba announced that dvd players for its technology would be on the market by the end of 2005.   as we move from standard definition video images to high-definition images  we have a much greater need for storage   richard doherty  from panasonic s hollywood laboratories  one of the pioneers of blu-ray  told the bbc news website.  so by utilising blue laser-based technology we can make an optical laser disc that can hold six times as much as today s dvd.  a blu-ray disc will be able to store 50gb of high-quality data  while toshiba s hd-dvd will hold 30gb. mr doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all high-definition needs  including the ability to record onto the dvds and smaller discs to fit into camcorders. both toshiba and blu-ray are hopeful that the emerging dvd format war  akin to the betamax and vhs fight in the 1980s  can be resolved over the next year when next-generation dvd players start to come out. when players do come out  they will be able to play standard dvds too  which is good news for those who have huge libraries of current dvds.  but the support from vivendi and electronics arts is a big boost to blu-ray in the battle for supremacy.  gaming is a $20 billion industry worldwide  so is as crucial as the film industry in terms of money to be made.  the technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced optical-disc technologies   said michael heilmann  chief technology officer for vivendi universal.  blu-ray offers the capacity  performance and high-speed internet connectivity to take us into the future of gaming.  ea  a leading games developer and publisher  added that the delivery of high-definition games of the future was vital and blu-ray had the capacity  functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning. sony recently announced it would be using the technology in its next generation of playstations. mr doherty said gamers were  ravenous  for high-quality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles.  gamers  especially those working on pcs  are always focused on more capacity to deliver textures  deeper levels  for delivering higher-resolution playback.   he added:  the focus for games moving forward on increased immersion.   gaming companies really like to focus on creating a world which involves creating complicated 3d models and textures and increasing the resolution  increasing the frame rate - all of these are part of getting a more immersive experience.  fitting these models on current dvd technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost. as games move to more photo-real capability  the current technology is limiting.  they are thrilled at the advanced capacity to start to build these immersive environments   said mr doherty. currently  graphics-intensive pc games also require multiple discs for installation. high-definition dvds will cut down on that need. likewise  consoles rely on single discs  so dvds that can hold six times more data mean much better  high-resolution games. blu-ray has already won backing from major hollywood studios  such as mgm studios  disney  and buena vista  as well as top technology firms like dell  lg  samsung and phillips amongst others. while toshiba s hd-dvd technology has won backing from paramount  universal and warner bros.  the real world benefits (of hd-dvd) are apparent and obvious   said jim cardwell  president of warner home video. mr cardwell added that rapid time to market and dependability were significant factors in choosing to go with hd-dvd. both formats are courting microsoft to be the format of choice for the next generation xbox  but discussions are still on-going. next generation dvds will also be able to store images and other data. ces is the largest consumer electronics show in the world  and runs from 6 to 9 january.,4
tech,poles play with gameboy  blip-pop  a group of artists in poland has taken the cacophony of blips  boops and beeps created as players bash buttons on nintendo s handheld gameboy console to a new level.  the gameboyzz orchestra project has taken the game sounds to put together music tunes they have dubbed  blip-pop.  think of it as donkey kong meets norman cook  or maybe tetris takes on kraftwerk. any way you slice it  the sound is distinct. all the sounds are made by six nintendo gameboys  with a mixture of older models and newer advance sp handhelds. the gameboyzz orchestra project tweaks the software a bit  and then connects the units through a mixing board.  jarek kujda  one of the project s founding members has been into electronic music and video games  for a while now.   i was playing some experimental music and three  four years ago when i first used a gameboy in my band as a drum machine   said kujda. he realised that the console could be used as a rudimentary synthesizer. he wondered  if one gameboy can make music  what would happen if he put six of them together  kujda found five other people who were interested and the gameboyzz orchestra project was born.  gameboyzz orchestra project is more of an improvisational project   said kudja.  we prepare some patterns before a concert  and then improvise during the concert.  the group plays maybe four or five shows a year. malgorzata kujda  jarek s younger sister and a fellow band member  describes a gameboyzz orchestra project concert as a lot of noise.  for example  i make music with more hard beats and noises   she said.  but each of us makes another music  a different sound. and then in the concert we just improvise  and that i think is more fun for us.   the gameboyzz orchestra project admits they get mixed reactions from audiences. some love the group s music  and others are not quite sure what to make of it.  in the world of electronic music  these purveyors of blip-pop are not unique. but jarek kujda says they try to be unique.  we have lots of people making music on old school stuff  electronic old school stuff like commodore  atari  spectrum   he said.  we want to play only experimental music  not cover songs. we re something like an electronic jam session.  the gameboyzz orchestra project s tracks are available online and the group hopes to make a cd next year. and they have sponsorship  courtesy of the polish distributor of nintendo products. the members of the gameboyzz orchestra project do not expect serious competition anytime soon. a gameboy advance costs about us $200 in poland these days  which is still way beyond the reach of most polish gamers  or musicians.  clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world  a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production,4
sport,wood - ireland can win grand slam former captain keith wood believes ireland can win only their second grand slam - and first since 1948 - in this year s rbs six nations championship.  after claiming their first triple crown for 19 years last season  wood tips his former team-mates to go one better.  things have been building up over the past few years and i think this is the year for ireland   he told bbc sport.  there is a great chance to win a grand slam. a lot of things are in our favour with england and france at home.  ireland have finished runners-up three times  including last year  since the old five nations became six in 2000  and not finished outside the top three in the past five years.  despite being without flanker keith gleeson  coach eddie o sullivan has not had to contend with the sort of casualty lists that have hit england and scotland in particular prior to the tournament.  for ireland to win it we need to stay relatively injury free  and fortunately we are one of the few teams that have done that so far   wood added.  it is going to be tough and we need to take all the luck and opportunities that come our way.  ireland s last game of the tournament is against wales in cardiff - a fixture they have not lost since 1983.  but despite their traditional hospitality when the irish are visiting  wood believes wales might end their four-match losing run against england in cardiff.  so many of the major england players have either retired in the last year or are injured that i think it will be very hard for them down in cardiff   wood added.  wales have had four brilliant games in the last year or so and lost all four  so the time is right for them now to beat one of the major teams.,3
sport,mcilroy continues winning streak james mcilroy stormed to his second international victory in less than a week  claiming the men s 800m at the teag indoor meeting in erfurt.  the northern ireland runner set a new personal best of one minute  46.68 seconds - a time good enough to qualify for the european indoor championships.  i m qualified now and that s what matters most   said the 28-year-old. mcilroy is now hoping to gain a late entry into sunday s international indoor meeting in leipzig. the northern irishman is hoping manager ricky simms can swing it for him to compete after he initially withdrew after contracting a cold. after three successive wins over the past fortnight  mcilroy is brimming with confidence.  i ve been waiting over six years for this to happen and now i m certain my career has turned the corner.  on friday  mcilroy delivered an impressive run despite suffering from his bad cold. the aaa indoor and outdoor champion accelerated away from the field in the final 300m  beating german wolfram mulle by 0.90 seconds. mcilroy set a world-leading mark for 1 000m at the sparkassen cup in stuttgart last weekend. and his time in erfurt makes him third fastest over 800m in the world this year.,3
politics,howard attacks  pay later  budget tory leader michael howard has dismissed gordon brown s budget as  vote now  pay later  spending plans.  the simple fact was that under a new labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole  mr howard said. everyone could see the chancellor s  sweeteners   but these hid tax rises for hard working families  he said. labour s  faltering election campaign  would not be helped by the package of measures  mr howard added.  mr brown s budget was not about what was good for the country  but  all about the interests of the labour party   the tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign. he went on to accuse mr brown of giving with one hand while taking away with the other. he urged the chancellor to admit he had been responsible for dragging  millions of people in to the net  to pay stamp duty and inheritance tax.  we can all see the sweeteners  but they hide the crippling tax rises for hard-working families that are inevitable if labour wins.   he also accused the government and the chancellor of running out of solutions to the problems britain faced.  their only answer is to tax  to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later.  mr brown liked to rattle off  magical balances conjured out of thin air  in a bid to convince people there was no  black hole  in the nation s finances  the tory leader said.  this dodgy government that brought us the dodgy dossier is now publishing a dodgy budget based on dodgy numbers   he said.  you now propose to borrow  over the next six years  no less than Â£168 billion; so much for prudence.  the chancellor s forecasts of surpluses are no better than the prime minister s forecasts of weapons of mass destruction.   mr brown s council tax rebate for pensioners was Â£300 less than what the tories were offering  mr howard said. there was nothing in the budget that would put more police on the streets  make hospitals cleaner or give parents and teachers the discipline and skills they wanted in schools. people would face a  clear choice  at the election  either  more waste and higher taxes under labour or lower taxes and value for money with the conservatives   he said.  that s the battleground of this election. that s what this election is going to be all about and i say bring it on   he concluded  to loud tory cheering.,2
sport,italy 17-28 ireland two moments of magic from brian o driscoll guided ireland to a workmanlike victory against italy.  a pair of classic outside breaks from the ireland captain set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer. italy led 9-8 early in the second half but stringer s try gave ireland a lead they never lost. the hosts cut the gap to 18-12 with 10 minutes left and nearly scored through ludovico nitoglia  but denis hickie s try ensured an irish victory. italy came flying out of the blocks and took the lead through a luciano orquera penalty after seven minutes.  it could have been better for the hosts but the fly-half missed two kickable penalties and ireland drew level with a ronan o gara penalty midway through the first half. the italians were driving at the heart of the irish defence and  for the first quarter  the irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs.  when they finally did  just before the half-hour mark  o driscoll promptly created a sparkling try for murphy. the ireland captain ran a dummy scissors and made a magical outside break before drawing the full-back and putting the diving murphy in at the corner. o gara missed the twice-taken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again. roland de marigny took over the kicking duties for italy from the hapless orquera  and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge italy into a 9-8 lead.  the only ireland player offering a real threat was o driscoll  and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors. shane horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and stringer scooted over  with o gara landing the tricky conversion. a penalty apiece saw ireland leading 18-12 as the game entered the final quarter  but they were lucky to survive when italy launched a series of attacks. winger nitoglia dropped the ball as he reached for the line and italy nearly rumbled over from a driving maul.  an o gara penalty put ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when hickie latched onto an inside pass from murphy and crossed for a converted try. o driscoll limped off late on  joining centre partner gordon d arcy on the sidelines  and the final word went to italy. prop martin castrogiovanni powered over for a try which was fitting reward for an italian pack which had kept the irish under pressure throughout.  de marigny; mi bergamasco  canale  masi  nitoglia; orquera  troncon; lo cicero  ongaro  castrogiovanni; dellape  bortolami; persico  ma bergamasco  parisse.  perugini  intoppa  del fava  dal maso  griffen  pozzebon  robertson.  murphy  horgan  o driscoll  d arcy  hickie  o gara  stringer  corrigan  byrne  hayes  o kelly  o connell  s easterby  leamy  foley.  sheahan  horan  o callaghan  miller  g easterby  humphreys  dempsey.  p o brien (new zealand),3

tech,movie body targets children s pcs the body that represents the us movie industry has released its latest tool in its campaign to clamp down on movie file-sharing  aimed at parents.  the movie association for america s (mpaa) free parent file scan software lets parents check their children s computers for peer-to-peer programs. it will also list all movie and music files they have on their hard drive. parents then have the choice to remove programs and files. the mpaa said files found would not be passed on to it.  our ultimate goal is to help consumers locate the resources and information they need to make appropriate decisions about using and trading illegal files   said dan glickman  mpaa chief.  many parents are concerned about what their children have downloaded and where they ve downloaded it from.   but some computer users who had tested the latest software reported on some technology sites that the program had identified windows default wav files as copyrighted material and wanted to delete them. movie piracy cost the industry Â£3.7bn ($7bn) in 2003  according to analysts. the mpaa said in a statement that it would continue to provide easy access to similar tools in the coming months to combat  the deleterious effects of peer-to-peer software  including such common problems as viruses  trojan horses and identity theft .  mr glickman said that the film industry was embracing  digital age technologies   like movielink and cinemanow  which are legal movie sites.  but legal services such as these need a chance to grow and thrive without having to compete against illegitimate operations that depend on stolen property to survive   he added. the industry body also said it had launched a second round of legal action against online movie-swappers across the us  but did not say how many were being sued. its first set of lawsuits were filed in november 2004. it also started a campaign against operators of bittorrent  edonkey and directconnect peer-to-peer networks. the first convictions for peer-to-peer piracy were handed out in the us in january. william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music  movies and software.,4
politics,uk needs tax cuts  tories insist a major change of direction is needed in britain if it is to prosper  the shadow chancellor said as the tory party spring conference began.  oliver letwin said the uk could not compete with other countries without the Â£4bn tax cuts he was promising. tory co-chairman liam fox had opened the forum in brighton with an attack on labour s record and party leader michael howard is due to speak later. tony blair has said conservative policies would cause economic failure. but mr letwin said britain had fallen from fourth to 11th in the international economic competitiveness league.   can this country compete  can this country prosper  unless we do something about the burden of regulation and tax on our economy   he said.  if we are going to take on the great challenges  the challenges like those posed by the chinese and the indians  we have got to do something about getting down the burden of regulation and getting down the burden of tax   he said.  the fact is the very carefully costed  fully funded plans we have laid out for saving Â£12bn by 2007-2008 are absolutely crucial to delivering an economy that will prosper and provide people with jobs and indeed provide the public services with the money they need on a sustainable long-term basis.  mr letwin said voting for labour meant choosing higher taxes  borrowing and waste.  earlier  dr fox had said labour s rule had been characterised by  lost trust and failure to deliver . he also attacked the government s  failure  to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the nhs  telling delegates labour cannot be trusted on education or crime. a tory government would sort out the  shambles  of immigration  put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools  he said. michael howard  who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on friday  will address them in a lunchtime speech. his welcome address had to be postponed after he stayed in london to lead the party s opposition to the prevention of terrorism bill in its lengthy progress through parliament. the bill was finally passed on friday evening  after more than 30 hours of debate. mr howard is likely to defend his party s handling of the bill  which was only passed after the conservatives accepted prime minister tony blair s promise that mps would be able to review it within a year.,2
